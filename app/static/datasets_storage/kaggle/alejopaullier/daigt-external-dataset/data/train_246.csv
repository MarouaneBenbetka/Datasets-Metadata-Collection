Task: Write a persuasive essay on whether or not classes from home should be offered as an option for students to attend. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes from home, as well as the effect it may have on learning. Cite examples to support your argument.","
When considering the pros and cons of attending classes from home, there is no doubt that there are a variety of advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it eliminates the need for physical attendance to classrooms, reduces the psychology of peer pressure, and eliminates potential health risks resulting from attending crowded places. In addition, students have the opportunity to arrange their learning environment according to their preferences and better manage their own time. On the other hand, there could be a lack of social interaction with classmates, a lack of guidance from instructors, and potential technical issues as well. 

However, in the end, the effect that home-based classes will have on learning is largely dependent on the situation of the student. For example, those who are already motivated to learn and are self-disciplined may reap the full benefits of studying in the comfort of their own home. Conversely, for those who require more interaction and guidance that comes with physical classrooms, a home-based learning style may not be as effective. 

Therefore, when it comes to allowing students the option to attend classes from home, there are intricacies that need to be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the best decision is made. Ultimately, this decision will depend on the individual student and their ability to take advantage of the opportunities available to them."
60623DB5DE7A,"Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they won't be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc.

A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they won't have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home.

Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs.

Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad. I can get another job to work on the weekends, the thing is that it would allow me to be busy, and to generate money.

In my family, my dad is the one who is always at work, he works from 8am to 6pm everyday, he doesn't have a day off, but it is okay for him. My mom, she doesn't work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldn't be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off.

In conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.","
Task: Research the advantages and disadvantages of a four-day school week and write an essay to determine if this model should be implemented at a school.","
One of the primary arguments for implementing a four-day school week is the potential cost savings. Many schools are currently operating at a budget deficit and a four-day week could help those districts by reducing the amount of money spent on utilities, staff, and transportation. Additionally, students would also be provided with an extended weekend, reducing the amount of stress they experience during the week. 

However, there are several potential drawbacks as well. For instance, students may struggle to stay motivated and focused with the extra day off. Furthermore, a four-day school week may also increase the likelihood of teachers needing to miss class and disrupt lesson plans. Additionally, it may be difficult to plan certain events such as field trips, sports games, and Parent-Teacher Conferences. 

Ultimately, while a four-day school week may have some benefits, a thorough assessment of both the advantages and disadvantages must be taken into consideration before implementing it at a school. It is important to weigh both the potential cost savings and the potential negative effects of such a schedule in order to make an informed decision."
607A39D981DE,"Students and their families should consider any activitie that they want to get involved in school before getting in. If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also won't be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have.

First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school.

If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities.

If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities.

Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didn't understand in the class.

I think Schools should not control students involvents.

Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students. When students are responsible with their shool work, and their activities, they should get extra credit.      ","

Emerson's was right with this quote people have think more then just of what they believe, if they grow they will achieve their dreams if they achieve they will grow you just have to believe in what you are.

Unless you try to do something respect, you have to do the best of you if you want to grow. Base in my experiences I'm growing, I try hard, and I try to convince the other do to the same, we want a better world we students to grow if they grow this will be a proud for the others. If we don't an open mind this will be the opposite we will never grow,no matter what is happening he we have to grow.

Task: Write an essay discussing the benefits of pushing yourself beyond what you have already mastered in order to grow and achieve your dreams. Use Emerson's quote as a starting point and back it up by citing real life examples from your own experiences.","
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you’ve imagined"". These inspiring words provide a valuable insight into the importance of pushing ourselves to strive for more in life. By pushing ourselves to push beyond our current level of mastery, there is more potential to grow and achieve our wildest dreams.

I have had many experiences in my life affirming this notion, particularly with regards to educational achievements. During my university years, I was often in situations where I had to push myself beyond what I knew I could do in order to get a desired result. For example, I recall a time when I had to work extra hard to manage a difficult assignment in a short time-frame. With a focused mindset and a strong work ethic, I surpassed my own expectations. In the end, I achieved a grade that I was proud of and as a result, I felt a great sense of accomplishment and growth.

Overall, pushing ourselves beyond what we have already mastered provides an invaluable opportunity to learn, experience, and create something that we may have thought was an impossibility. As Emerson said, by going confidently in the direction of our dreams, we are giving ourselves a chance to realize our full potential and to achieve amazing feats."
60AE13D3F07B,"I think our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters. It is the responsibility of adults to teach their child how to behave and that is usually how their traits are formed. As children begin to go to school, most often they meet other kids and become friends. Friends also have an influence on how traits are formed like for example: Kindness, friendly, honest, and more. The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences. Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm. These traits for formed because of school and my friends. John Lubock mentions that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

Task: Research and discuss how character traits are formed in humans, paying particular attention to the influence of parents, siblings, friends, and school.","
Human character traits are shaped by a wide range of influences. Most notably, the early influences of parents, siblings, friends, and school can greatly impact the development of a person’s character traits. Parents, for example, can have a major influence on a child’s moral compass by providing consistent guidance and setting a positive example of how to act and treat others. Siblings can also be powerful models of behavior that have a significant impact on the development of character traits, particularly in the areas of cooperation, communication, and leadership. Friends can offer insights to beliefs, values, and lifestyles that can influence a person’s character traits. And, of course, schools can provide opportunities for academic growth, as well as the potential for exploring different intellectual pursuits, developing social skills, understanding cultural norms, and engaging in activities that can shape a person’s character traits. All of these influences serve to form and inform a person’s character traits, and so a better understanding of them can be advantageous."

Task: Write an essay exploring the pros and cons of online classes, considering factors such as student engagement, difficulty of passing, and student-teacher relationships.","
Online classes have been increasingly popular as technology advances and the need for social distancing increases. There are several advantages and disadvantages to taking courses online. One pro is that online classes can be taken at any time and from any location, making them more accessible to people who have difficulty attending a standard class. There is also evidence that online classes can foster student engagement as students are in control of when and how they access their education. Additionally, online classes make it easier for students to collaborate and communicate with one another in discussion forums or chat rooms. 

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to taking online classes. It can be difficult for students to motivate themselves when there is no professor present and no regular deadlines and expectations. Online classes also often lack the personal connections and relationships that come from face-to-face instruction. Furthermore, several studies have shown that students tend to be less successful in passing online classes than in traditional classroom courses.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to taking online classes, there are also disadvantages to consider. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to take online classes should be made on an individual basis, taking into account student engagement, difficulty of passing, and student-teacher relationships."
60CCF0F2DF38,"Dear Winston Churchill,

I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"".

The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.

I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.

In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

Sincerely,

Task:
1. Research prominent successful individuals and the role that failure played in their success.
2. Find evidence to support the claim that ""failing is the key to success"".
3. Write a personal story that illustrates how failure has contributed to success.
4. Outline the essay by writing a thesis statement and main points to be included.
5. Draft the essay.
6. Proofread and revise the essay to ensure it conveys the intended message.","
No matter how hard we work or how much ambition and motivation we have, failure is as much a part of success as accomplishments. This is evidenced by the countless prominent successful individuals who have experienced numerous struggles on their path to success. For example, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was famously fired from the company he helped build, only to return and lead it to even greater success. His famous quote, “sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick,” serves as a reminder that failure is a necessary challenge to encounter when striving for greater success. 

This essay aims to address how failure can ultimately be a key element to achieving success. By exploring specific real-world examples of prominent successful individuals, exploring the relationship between failure and success, and looking at my own life experiences, I will demonstrate that experiencing failure can be an essential step towards success. 

First, by looking at the lives of prominent successful individuals, we can see the role of failure in their success. From Elon Musk to Oprah Winfrey, there are countless stories of individuals who have failed on their paths to becoming global success stories. And not just small setbacks – individuals like Thomas Edison, for example, demonstrated the huge leaps of progress that can made from grappling with mistakes, which ultimately became the foundation for some of his most impressive accomplishments. 

We can also look at the relationship between failure and success in our own lives. I, for one, have experienced numerous failures while working towards a goal. In particular, while preparing for my college entrance exams, I was faced with many challenges and failed the first few tests. It was not until I looked at the mistakes I made that I could understand what I was doing wrong and make necessary changes in my studying approach. 

In conclusion, it is clear that failure can be a powerful stepping stone to success. Prominent successful individuals serve as examples of how mistakes can lead to great accomplishments. Furthermore, by reflecting on our own life experiences, we can understand the significance of failure in helping us grow and reach our goals. As such, it is crucial to embrace failure in any endeavor in order to reach true success."
60D8EB883A45,"CAN WE ACCOMPLISH BY ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING OR NOT DOING SOMETHING

Can people accomplish by always doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Do we accomplish more if we are always not doing something productive? No, being inactive won't help accomplish nothing just by standing or laying down at home doing nothing. Although, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. People would learn more things, meet new people to achieve goals in life and how much can be done if we are always doing something.

People would learn more things if they are more productive. I remember when my mom signed me up for a soccer team. I didn't know I was going to be joining a soccer team, or wanted to play on the soccer team;however, I did it and I learn how to kick a soccer ball, how to be a golly and I improved my speed. Another example was when I had a vocabulary test for English but I didnt know half of the vocabulary words, so I study till I learned the words.

Meeting new people to achieve a goals. I like being a indoor person, but when soccer season comes and I join a team I interact with new people and coaches to achieve my goals on how to become a better teammate or how I can improve my speed and mentality to become a great soccer player. Another example was when I talked to a new math teacher to help me on a equation I didnt understand. he helped me understand the equation, and helps me every time I need help on something in math now.

Imagine how much can be done if we are always doing something. people would be able to accomplish so many goals if we are always doing something instead of staying home and laying down and watch TV all day. when we get some free time we can work on something that would help us in the future and make us think better. Maybe when we think we dont need help, but actually do ask someone to help you to understand more instead of staying with the same mindset.

Although, some people maybe don't got that much time to accomplish things. Thats why they go inactive but still accomplish their goal on a long term time. Inactivity also can also serve a purpose, depending on the person maybe they dont got money or a transportation vehicle to get to their destination. Although, they can't just do nothing and wait for something good to happen to them.

People can accomplish their goals by always doing something that would helped them in the future. Thomas Jefferson wrote,''Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" People would learn more things, meeting new people to achieve a goal and how much can be done if we are always doing something productive.

4. Evaluate the pros and cons of always doing something and not doing something to accomplish goals.
5. Write an essay on the topic","

Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, “Determine never to be idle… It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.” The main point of this quotation is that when we stay active and keep doing something, we can get things done. Staying active means staying focused on the goals we want to achieve. Making a plan to accomplish our goals and having the dedication to complete it can bring amazing results. 

On the other hand, when we are inactive and not accomplishing tasks, it can be detrimental to progress. If we are idle for too long and do not put effort into our goals, they may remain stagnant and we might miss out on opportunities. In addition, too much inactivity can lead to laziness, apathy and depression. 

Therefore, it’s important to evaluate both the pros and cons of always doing something and not doing something to accomplish goals. Doing something shows dedication and passion for our goals while doing nothing might make us miss out on important progress. When considering this quote, it’s important to strike a balance when pursuing our goals. By doing too much, we can exhaust ourselves and affect our mental and physical health. But when doing too little, it could affect our progress just the same. 

Overall, the quote “Determine never to be idle… It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing” by Thomas Jefferson is an inspiring reminder to stay active and move forward with our goals. It’s essential to be both active and restful in order to have balance and obtain our goals in life."

Task: Write an essay about the impact your grandfather had on your love for soccer and why you would like to visit Florida.","
My grandfather was a huge influence on my love for soccer. Growing up, I spent every Sunday after church with him watching soccer games on TV. The energy and passion of the crowds in the stadiums seemed to come alive through the television, and it was contagious. Grandpa taught me about teamwork, sportsmanship, and the rewards of hard work and self-discipline, and these things have stayed with me to this day. 

I have always wanted to visit Florida to get a full feel of its soccer culture. From the Orlando City Soccer Club to the Florida Cup, I would love to wander through the streets, checking out the soccer shops and meeting other soccer fans. Florida is also home to many of the USA’s best professional and college teams, and it would be a great opportunity to see the game at its highest level. 

My visits to Florida would be a great way to honor my grandfather’s memory and to celebrate the bond he and I shared over our shared love of soccer. No matter what, I know I will always fondly remember our Sunday afternoons together, cheering for our favorite teams and talking about the great players of the game. "
60E686BA1E09,"When people ask for advise, they usually don't know what path or choice to make.

When people make a wrong desition they can mess something up in their life. That can mean the world to them like a wife/husban or his/her kids. They can set a bad influence on small kids by going to jail or by doing something a criminal might do. That is why most people go to jail and don't come out for a very long long time. That sucks to not see your mom/dad for a very long time and that can be depressing on some people.

Then if they make a good choice they won't get in trouble or get in federal trouble. that can make a good influence on your childeren and that can give them a better futer in this world. If you talk to the right person that gives you good advise. That can be a very good choice for you and your family because they won't have to see you in jail through a little window.

Just what im saying is if you mess up by talking to the wrong person you can set a bad influence on people, more family and that would suck to see your chidren and wife through a little window in a prison trust me I have been through it all. if you get in bad trouble you can probubly fix it and just get a ticket, fin, or mistimener you can fix it dont make the wrong choice and get in trouble do what you think is the best for you and your family. Don't think bout other just worry bout you and your family not anybody else

This is what can go good for you, if you make the right choice you can go to college and get a degree in something you like. You can get a good job and get a good house, good car and always have money on you just in case of anything. You also can help out your perents get a good house and you won't have to put them in a home and you can also bye what your kids want when ever they wan't and you won't have to go through the bad stuff in the world like most people go through to put food on the table.","

Task: 

1. Research the personal stories of successful people to learn how they triumphed over failure. 
2. Reflect on personal experiences to see how failure has helped shape one’s life. 
3. Analyze ways that failure contributes to personal growth and how this growth helps to achieve success.
4. Consider how to stay focused and motivated to reach goals even in the face of failure.

As I dug into the personal stories of successful people, one common theme stood out – their resilience in the face of failure. Whether it was Mark Zuckerburg learning to code after multiple failed attempts to launch a software company, or J.K. Rowling persisting despite rejection of her Harry Potter manuscripts, there’s something to be learned from their perseverance.   

I was reminded of my own experiences of coming up short and using those moments as a springboard for growth. As I processed these feelings, I was able to reflect on how failure has shaped me as a person and pushed me farther down the path that led me to success. 

I identified the ways that failure had contributed to my own growth and the impact it had on helping me reach my goals. I realized that to stay focused and motivated, it was important to create an environment that nurtured learning and positive self-belief. 

I was grateful for the support of my family and friends, who provided me with the encouragement and emotional support to stay the course. Through the combination of stumbling, finding solutions, and never giving up, I was able to take failure in stride, to ride the wave of success."

I think the author waldo Emerson wrote he reference about like what you doing alone in one world if you care the world o destroy de world if u can alone or need support the people.","
Task: 
Write an essay that explores the idea of being alone in the world and examines whether it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others. Consider the implications of the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson in your analysis.","
In his essay ""Self-Reliance"", Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""The great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude."" This statement captures the essence of the idea of being alone in the world – that is, one can be surrounded by people, yet remain independent and content despite the lack of connection with them.

Nevertheless, while Emerson's words might suggest that it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others, this idea is unrealistic in practice. Human beings rely on each other for countless things - whether it is emotional support, advice, or practical assistance in achieving something. In this sense, going it alone is rarely a viable option, and as such, it is difficult to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.

At the same time, this does not mean that it is impossible to do something meaningful alone. In fact, there are many examples of individuals who have made significant contributions without any sort of supportive network. One could argue that learning to rely on oneself could be a meaningful achievement in its own right. Therefore, while it is true that living a life without the help and support of others is more difficult, it is not impossible. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to determine whether it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others."
60FD2E2FB768,"Imagine you are in school and you had to sit an a room with four wall. Moreover, you had a frustrating day because of teachers, students and school work. And then you had to stay in that room for another one and a half hour. How would you feel after all of that? Beside, students might not function well, since there is more class time which means more classwork and homework. That is why the school board should not add one and half hour to the school day.

First, some students have sports, clubs and many things to do after school. However, they are tired from the school and school work as a result, they will not function right. For example, my friend plays soccer and she had school for another one and half hour when she went to practice she passed out, since her brain was not function nether were her body. An addition, when students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside. Which is a unfair for students and it's bad for the students safety.

Next, students will not have time to spend with there family members nor there friends because they would have homework and projects to do. Neither will teacher have time to spend with there kids, since they have test to grad and paper work. In the same token, students would not be motive to play or have fun because all they would think about is school. Beside, the students will not have a lot of time to sleep.

Furthermore, one day the students will not have the energy to go to school. Similarly, they will become depressed and have a negative mood. And the students might not even want to come to school any more. Which put the students in a high risk.

Task:

Research and analyze the implications of adding an extra hour and a half to the school day, including the effects it would have on students, teachers, and their families. Compare these effects to the benefits of having more class time, such as additional time to complete coursework. Discuss the pros and cons of adding an extra hour and a half to the school day.","
After much research and analysis, it is clear that adding an extra hour and a half to the school day can have both positive and negative implications for students, teachers, and their families. On one side, students would be able to gain more opportunities to have more class time to complete their coursework, have additional tutoring, and benefit from other extended educational experiences. On the other hand, studies suggest that increasing the school day could also lead to higher levels of stress for both students and teachers, increased behavioral issues in the classrooms, and less family time. Furthermore, if parents are not able to adjust their work hours to accommodate the extended school days, this could lead to further challenges for the students and potential childcare issues for the families. While the extra hour and a half of school time could provide additional educational opportunities, it is important to consider the balance of benefits and risks in order to make an informed decision."
610FA0016255,"Self-esteem doesn't come from praise or achievement, In my opinion both of those are only ""supporters"" to recognize the person effort, all of about self steem really comes from ourselves, our thoughts, ideas and efforts we've done. Self-esteem is what to make you be,what you transmit, act or just to look like, that's why is really important to have that present beacuse evryone should have self-esteem.

Some people believe in praising a student's to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention.

Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while they're doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldn't do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has.

First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they don't, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they don't.

In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us what's to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, we'll not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because we'd already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove we're good on something, it's completetly wrong, you don't have to get an achievement to prove you're good on something you like it or enjoy to do.

The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because you're waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself.

Not always everything is gonna be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every human've had self-esteem issues at least once and that's alright. I think we shouldn't depend on a opinion to get better each day for ourselves, we've to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone always will be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledged, that's where self-esteem comes from.","
Task: 
Think about times you had to make an effort and how it felt to receive praises or achievements. Reflect on how your self-esteem was affected by these experiences. Write an essay about the importance of having self-esteem and the role that praising and achievements play in building it.","
    
One of the most crucial components of personal well-being is self-esteem. Having strong self-esteem allows us to make balanced decisions, build meaningful relationships, and have a positive attitude toward life. It is important to recognize the role that praising and achieving can play in rising our self-esteem.

When we make an effort and receive positive praise, it can give us a great sense of accomplishment, leading to a boost in our self-esteem. It can make us feel appreciated and validated, reinforcing the belief that we are worthwhile and capable individuals. Similarly, when we attain a goal or an achievement, it can be extremely rewarding and can provide us with a great sense of pride.

The feeling of accomplishment that comes from praise and achievements can help cultivate and sustain our self-esteem, allowing us to face any future challenge with courage and optimism. Through this, we can become more confident in our potentials and be driven to continue to make an effort to reach our goals.

Therefore, it is essential to recognize and make use of the positive influences that praising and achievements can have on our self-esteem. By recognizing their potential impact, we can cultivate a strong sense of self-worth and appreciation for our unique abilities. This is essential for a healthy and balanced lifestyle."

Additionaly we can stop the kind of problem if we work together helping each other.

It's wonderful if peolpe work as a community and tryed to help other,cause Thomas Jefferson was a men who like to help people on what he can.

In Thomas Jefferson's words, ""Never be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" These words evoke an idea that is still relevant in society today - the importance of not being idle. With a global pandemic having affected much of our everyday life, it is more important than ever for young people to stay busy and productive.

Through Jefferson's words, young people are not only inspired to make use of their free time constructively but also strive to help others. With the current state of the world, we can come together by taking action to combat destructive idling. This could look like volunteering in local food banks, finding creative ways to engage with friends and family online, or even taking up a new hobby. No matter how big or small the contributions are, we can all do our part to not be idle.

Ultimately, Jefferson's words help us recognize the importance of not being idle and how it can both challenge and motivate us to strive to better our society. By using our time wisely, we can all come together and make a difference for future generations."
61445D1ABF16,"One...two...three...START! Identify an enjoyable educational activity such as doing the science fair, singing, playing an instrument and many others. In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career.

First of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. I mostly take a break whenever I'm taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because it's really fun in my opinion. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling.

Second, I could find new styles in my art. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. It's very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. I could draw how it's like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life.

Additionally, it could be my future career. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. There are many art programs in college and I'm mostly interested in doing animation. Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. 3D animation is more realistic and it's a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. Mostly my future job would be an animator since I've drew so much in my life.

I love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life. It could be very hard sometimes but it is still fun to do.","

We all have unique personalities and regardless of our similarities, our individual traits are what make us stand out. People can have a bad day for a variety of reasons. Stress, exhaustion, and feeling overwhelmed can all lead to a poor mood. Additionally, some people may struggle with depression or anxiety. It's important to take the time to recognize the reasons why you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and tackle the issues head-on. 

First impressions are not necessarily who a person is. People can grow and change over time and they can choose to challenge their first impressions of one another and create deeper relationships. It's important to give people the benefit of the doubt. Spend time getting to know the people you meet and take the time to understand them instead of judging them on a surface level. Together, we can work to prevent snap judgments and build a strong foundation of mutual respect."
615FAEE4F8EF,"School should not extend the school days more than eight hours. Some people think that spending more time at school would be a good idea because students would have more time to study. Others think that An 8 hours of school time is enough time to study every day. This is an controversial issue and school time should not be too much .This change would affect students and teachers because some students have part time jobs,students would not have enough time to do their daily activities with friends and family,teachers and students would be tired by the the end of the day and they would not do good.

Some students have part time jobs and they take some rest before going to work after school. Some students go to work right away after every school to get out early and do their homework after. By adding two hours a to the school schedule would make students who have job work till late. Even though some students need to work as much time as they can to help their families or pay something they are trying to buy. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work.

Another reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities. Students hang out with family and friends. Some students are part of a sport team and they have to have time to go practice. Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students have to take care of their little siblings after school because their parent have to go shopping or work. Students also need to do what they like and by doing that they would be more active.

Another reason is that teachers and students would be tired by the the end of a ten hours school day and they would not do good. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. Some students do not want to do their work in the last class and some fall sleep even in a eight hours school day. Even teachers would get tired of being teaching and grading papers all day long. When it comes to a history teacher they have to talk a lot in every class and they get tired. By making every school day 10 hours long would put to much pressure to students and teachers that they would be exhausted by the end of the day that they would not be able to pay attention in their work.

School itself it hard sometimes but working and studding is even worst and those who work and study at the same time often need time time to get things done, and by spending too much time in just one thing can affect the other .Every one has personal things and activities to do and some require certain among of time. Studing and teaching requieres focus and creativity but when students and teachers get tired all that is missing.","

The issue of whether or not school days should be extended beyond 8 hours is a controversial one that has generated widely differing opinions.

616C3D5795E8,"I think i agree on the Churchill statement because :

every time you failure more and more ,every time you learn something new , for example :

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say ""you din't clean here or ""you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty"" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

remember to success you don""t even have to think about what you do wrong just keep working on it ,and keep dreaming!!!","
Task: Clean the house every Saturday for two months so that you can practice and improve your house cleaning skills.","
Every Saturday for the next two months, I'll dedicate my morning to cleaning the house. I'll start by vacuuming and dusting all of the rooms, as well as wiping down surfaces, like windowsills and countertops. Once that's done, I'll move on to mopping the floors and scrubbing the bathrooms. I'll make sure to get into all the nooks and crannies so that the house is spotless. By doing this regularly, I'll be able to practice and improve my house cleaning skills."
6186246910E1,"students should graduate in three years instead of four years.

It is better for students to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able tho help their families.

The first reason is that students will finish the career that they choose early. students will have 1 years less to graduate. For example, a student is planning to graduate in 2021 and start his career to finish it in 2026 but now that students will be allow to graduate 1 year early then the student will finish his career in 2025. It means that the students will reach their goals early. Students can reach a better life in less time working hard with positive mind.

The second reason is that students will be able to help their families. One year less make the difference. For example, a student's mother is really sick and the student have a part time job ,but he don't gain enough money to buy his mother medicines and he have to graduate but he is still in his third year of high school so he have one more year but now that he can graduate in three years he can receive his diploma and find a full job time to gain enough money to help his mother. It means that one year less can help you change the life of your family to better. One years less can brings chances for others.

Some people believe that students should not graduate in three years instead of four years. However, others including me believe that students should be allow to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able to help their families.              ","
Task: Write an essay arguing that students should be allowed to graduate in three years instead of four years.","
Graduating from college in three years instead of four years is a great idea that should be considered by university administrators. Doing so would reduce the amount of time and money spent on education for students, allowing them to enter the workforce or pursue higher education much sooner. 

The idea of graduating college within a shorter period of time than four years is not a new concept. Some universities already offer three-year undergraduate programs, and these programs are successful and effective. Students are taking the same number of credits, taking advanced classes, and graduating at the same rate as those in four year degree programs. This demonstrates that graduating college in three years is not only feasible but also highly beneficial. 

For students looking to join the workforce after college quickly, three-year programs would help them start their careers sooner and begin making money. A bachelor’s degree takes time and money to acquire but having it in three years instead of four would make it more accessible to those for whom four-year degrees may not be feasible. Students would be able to access more opportunities with higher pay more quickly due to their accelerated timeline. The additional time would also give them the opportunity to pursue graduate studies or training for higher paying positions more quickly. 

In addition, three-year programs would be beneficial for universities by helping them save on money and resources. With more students completing their studies sooner, universities would save on housing, meals, tuition fees, and other expenses, allowing them to operate more efficiently. 

For all of these reasons, universities should consider allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four. It would be beneficial to everyone involved and would help ensure that everyone who wants to pursue a college degree is able to do so in a practical and efficient way."
61992F84D5D1,"When you are a kid your parents tell you what your character is have to be they teaching you how you have to be they intent to help you to be a better person, for example they tell you what is wrong and what not, what you can do and what you can't do.

But when you are a big person you can choose whoever your character is gonna be, for example you choose what is wrong and what is good for you because you are big now and you can do your own decision. You're able to thing and get the responsibilities to choose your own character, and you are agree if you make a mistake your gonna take the consequences, because your choose to be like that.

So is not beyond our control because you thing how you wanna be for your life for the things you are learned before in the past and that is the things the changing you. is nothing out of control because you can choose your character, Examples if theres a man who needs help you can choose be a good person and help him or just let him there and thats make you a a bad person and when you needs help nobody is gonna help you.

The character is important in a person because the character make you who you are thats why you have the power to choose what your character is gonna be you cna choose how you wanna be a good person or bad person and thats the person you wanna be.

And you character is what make you the person you are and the people is ginna say that your are a good person or not depend the what your character choose and thats it the character it was make a person.

So thats what i said, i said we choose our own character traits. ","
Task: Choose one trait your parents have taught you and discuss how it has shaped your character. Compare and contrast it to the way in which you chose to adopt certain character traits. Explore the idea of whether your character is truly within your control.","
Growing up, my parents taught me to always stay humble and true to myself. This lesson has stayed with me my entire life and continues to shape my character. I have taken this humble nature and used it to help me keep my feet firmly on the ground in all of life's challenges. It helps me to stay self-aware and critically think through situations before acting rashly. 

However, I have also adopted traits from the people I admire most; traits that challenge me to push and take chances. This has helped me become more courageous, forceful, and passionate about my goals. While it may have been beneficial for me to take these on, I must be careful not to do so at the expense of my humble nature.

This brings me back to the idea of whether or not I truly have total control of my character. On the one hand, it feels as though I have fully embraced the traits my parents taught me and I am certainly making conscious decisions to adopt certain character traits from others. On the other hand, I can never truly know how my upbringing, environment, and even genetics have contributed to forming my character. All I know is that no matter what, I will continue to strive to be the best version of myself."

61C4FCA012D7,"The school food should change because a lot of students they did not like it and many students feel sick when they eat school food and many students skip their lunch to go and buy food from stores if schools provides the same food for student many students will leave class and learn they will not lean anything for being late in the class and more.

The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have.

If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like.

Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat.

To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea. Otherwise it will clause same problem for school principal.","
Task: 

Investigate and write a persuasive essay about the pros and cons of changing the school menu concerning student health and academic performance. Include examples from your own school or other schools to explain your point of view.","
When discussing the pros and cons of changing the school menu for the benefit of student health and academic performance, it is important to consider both sides. On one hand, providing students with healthy meals provides the essential nutrients and energy needed to focus in class and refrain from getting sick. Studies have shown that students who regularly eat healthful school lunches tend to have higher grade point averages and miss fewer days of school. For example, a study conducted at a high school in California found that students who ate school lunches had higher grades than those who brought their own.

On the other hand, changing the school menu may present more challenges than benefits. As schools transition to healthier options, students may not take the change positively, leading to lack of interest in the meals and potential food waste. Additionally, some students may require additional dietary accommodations that may not be available in the new menu. Furthermore, although healthier options can be more expensive, school budgets are limited. Having to pay for these meals could place an additional burden on students and families. Ultimately, the key is providing students with healthy options that are both delicious and affordable."

Advice is something you seek, and search you can ask advice on anything it can be advice for you hair, advice for you dog, doctor advice you can partially ask advice on anything.

When it comes to getting advice, it's often best to consult with multiple people. By having a variety of perspectives on a subject from different people, you can get a better idea of what the right decision is for you. People often seek advice on matters such as career paths, relationships, financial decisions, or life decisions. Hearing different perspectives from a range of people can be beneficial and help provide a comprehensive outlook. 

Furthermore, asking for advice is an opportunity to learn something new. People often bring up useful information that you may not have known previously. You might hear of new ideas and opportunities, or even be presented with tools and resources that can help you along the way.

61E85C09E36D,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble,or do they unfairly interfere young people's lives?

In my opinion yes curfews have to take care of them , it does matter if they are young, Also if they are in the night. This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers.

For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get a trouble , because they going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules .

Otherwise nobody are in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers.

Also in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you , why? to you because maybe you are watch what others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something.

Some people thing that have fun in the night is good idea. but is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you don't not anybody ,or something can happen ,for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die. In conclusion curfews have to take care of the teenagers this is good for them.  ","
Task: Write an essay about whether curfews keep teenagers out of trouble or unfairly interfere with their lives. 
A. Identify what curfews are and why they are instituted.
B. Summarize arguments for and against curfews.
C. Provide real-life examples of how curfews have been beneficial or detrimental.
D. Draw a conclusion based on the evidence presented.","
    Curfews are laws or regulations that restrict the movement of teenagers in public places during certain hours of the day, usually at night. They are often instituted by governments or private organizations such as schools, in order to protect teenagers from engaging in risky or illegal behavior. 

Proponents of curfews argue that they reduce the likelihood of crime and that they can also act as a parental tool for monitoring their child's activities. On the other hand, opponents of curfews argue that restricting movement of young people unfairly interferes with their basic rights, and stifles creativity and personal development.

In some cases, curfews have been effective in curbing juvenile crime in particular areas. For example, in the city of Oakland, California, local officials observing a decrease in crime in areas where the curfew was introduced. On the other hand, there are also cases where curfews have had a detrimental impact on young people. For instance, in the United Kingdom, an 11pm curfew introduced during the coronavirus outbreak has had adverse effects on teenagers' mental health, with some feeling isolated and lonely due to the lack of social contact.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with curfews. It appears that curfews can be useful in keeping teenagers out of trouble in some cases, however, they can also interfere with their rights and limit their activities in other cases. The efficacy of curfews ultimately depends on the particular situation and context in which they are instituted."
62102D1B1A52,"Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive.

First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.

Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.

Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.

In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.","
Task: Read and analyze Winston Churchill’s statement on the importance of failure in the pursuit of success. Analyze how the statement applies to the examples of your own life experiences and of others to determine whether you agree with Churchill.","
In Winston Churchill’s statement on the importance of failure, he argued that failure is crucial for individuals seeking success. Identifying with this idea, I think of a time in my life when I failed and subsequently achieved success: when I got a low grade on a maths test, I worked harder to properly understand the material and ultimately did well in the following tests. Similarly, I can think of a friend of mine who failed his first driving test, but worked to understand driver safety laws better, and passed the test the second time. In both of these cases, failure was necessary for success. In agreement with Churchill, I believe failure is an essential part of the process of achieving long-term success."
62196AC0ABE8,"The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote you your character will be what you yourself choose. In my opinion we choose our own character, and how we respect other people teachers, and students. My mom teach me how to behavior but she do not choose my own character, nonetheless some peoples make us strong but they don't choose own character, but on the other hand sometimes we need to change our character for example, my English teacher have a beautiful character but apart from that, sometime she need to changes her character because the students do not put attention in the classroom, and she have to be rude that way they stop talking and distract the other students, but however she never change her beautiful character.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they don't gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we don't want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress. My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she don't choose how my character it gonna be

In other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they don't choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they can't teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character

The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character

Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile.","

1. Analyze John Lubbock's statement that one's character is chosen by oneself.
2. Compare and contrast how others, such as one's mother, can teach you how to behave, but cannot choose one's character.
3. Explore how sometimes it can be necessary to change one's character in order to help oneself or others.

John Lubbock's statement that one's character is chosen by oneself is widely accepted as one of the fundamental truths of life. Although it is important to be taught proper behavior and etiquette by our parents and the people around us, ultimately how we act and think is determined by ourselves alone. In certain circumstances, it can be advantageous to make adjustments to our character, mindset, and goals. It is possible to transform our character in order to overcome any limitations and help not only ourselves but others too. Maintaining a positive attitude and making sure that our character is founded in goodness and integrity is an integral part of fulfilling our potential and making the most of our lives."
62243789233B,"In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.","
Task:

1. Research the artist Michelangelo and his views on setting goals.
2. Analyze examples of taking risks and SETTING BIG goals by taking a look at a SHOW called Masterchef and analyzing a personal example of passing a permit test.
3. Explore how taking risks and failING can make you a better person.
4. Examine how Michelangelo and the writer agree on why it is better to set a bigger goal and fail rather than have a","
Throughout his life, Michelangelo was an advocate for setting ambitious goals and taking risks, regardless of the outcome. He said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” This sentiment resonates today as we look to examples of taking risks and setting big goals. 

One example can be seen in the popular television show Masterchef. Here, contestants put it all on the line in a high-stakes cook-off, showing the importance of setting big goals and having the courage to risk failure to achieve success. 

On a more personal level, many of us can look to our own lives for examples. Perhaps you set a goal to pass your permit test. Taking a risk and studying hard, you take the test with the anticipation and fear of failure looming in the back of your mind. When you find out you have passed the test, you are rewarded with the satisfaction of having taken the risk, worked hard, and accomplished your goal.

In the end, it’s important to take the advice of Michelangelo and others to heart. Taking risks and failing can be intimidating and even frightening, but it is often necessary in order to achieve greater successes. As Michelangelo said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” Taking risks can make us better people, and can help us to reach heights we might not have achieved otherwise."
622ECD91DA0C,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.

In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. For example, once I had a friend that talked really bad about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her.

In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be and you can't judge them on how they look. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. That's why I think that you can change first impressions.","
    Task: Write an essay discussing the argument that first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed. Consider evidence from personal experiences or other evidence that shows this statement is true.","
First impressions can be deceiving, and sometimes it’s not until we know someone better that we realize their true character. Despite popular belief, these first impressions can be changed over time. 

One example of this comes from my own personal experience. My best friend in high school was someone I initially thought I had nothing in common with. We had completely different personalities and interests, so much so that we rarely shared a conversation, let alone became friends. Fast forward to college, and we’re now more like siblings than friends. Despite our different backgrounds – she was a first-generation immigrant from East Asia and I’m from a rural background halfway across the world – we’ve grown to understand each other and found areas of shared interest that have helped bond us closer than ever.

This is further supplemented by scientific evidence that supports the idea that first impressions can be changed. In a study conducted in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, it was found that one’s perception of another person can be modified with knowledge. This knowledge often comes in the form of connecting with shared interests or gaining a true understanding of the other person’s true character. This in turn allows for the development of a meaningful relationship that alters the initial perception of the other persons traits. 

In conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed. This is evident in my own personal experience, as well as in various scientific studies that have been conducted. Understanding the true character of a person or gaining an understanding of shared interests has the potential to change the perception of a first impression, allowing for a strong connection."
623B7BD7613C,"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality.","
Task: Write an essay discussing the benefits of having freedom of action and thought in a world that is constantly trying to impose conformity. Be sure to include examples of why being yourself is important, and how having autonomy can positively affect an individual's personal growth.","
In today's world, the pressure of conformity is ever-increasing, making it important for individuals to stand out and embrace freedom of action and thought. Autonomy is fundamental for achieving a sense of self, as it allows one to explore and discover their own identity outside the scope of society's expectations. With the freedom to choose and act according to one's own desires, an individual can develop a sense of autonomy and self-assuredness that, in turn, can lead to personal growth.

As an example, consider someone who wishes to pursue their passions and dreams and find fulfillment in life. Having freedom of thought and action means this individual is free to explore these possibilities, free to make mistakes and learn from them, free to internalize new values and develop their own beliefs. These activities, when done with purpose, can help teach an individual valuable life lessons and increase their sense of identity, instilling within them the confidence to reach for greater heights.

It is clear that having freedom of action and thought is essential in a society that pressures conformity. Without it, an individual can easily be led away from their true identity because of external expectations. Thus, it is important to remain true to oneself and not be swayed by influences, and to continue to explore new ideas and opportunities in order to maximize personal growth."
623E0AD2EF3E,"Whats one place you would love to visit? One place I would like to visit is Ethiopia. I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years. Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members go eat Ethiopian food with them and cherish that moment forever.

I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years, lots of things has changed from then to now. But those past couple of years in Ethiopia wasn't the best for people who live there or who has family there. For Example my grandpa died a couple days after my 11th birthday and even though I didnt cry, scream, or kick that day or the day after that, it made a horrible impact on my life and my mothers. Secondly, There was a plane crash this year, more than 200 people were affected and one out of those 200 people happened to be one of my close friends. In addition to that there was a war a couple months ago that I didnt know about till a friend came up to me and said ""How do you feel about the war thats going on in Ethiopia"" I didnt know what to say because I had no clue that there was a war I felt ashamed that I didnt know what was going on in my own country. I've lost a lot of people i've cared about those past three years and I couldnt do anything about it because i was a million miles away.

Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. I hate having to talk to them on the phone and not being able to hug or see them in person, I hate having only 30 minutes to talk on the phone when I can talk to my relatives for hours in person, I hate how I am paying two dollars everyday just to talk to them when we can talk for free in person. Since I havent seen my family members in a long time I feel like I have a obligation to see them. I can get them small things from America and bring it to them, they can sell it to get lots of money because one dollar here is $30 there or they can keep it and cherish it.

Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members, go eat Ethiopian food with them, and cherish that moment forever. I would go on long car rides because it would make some time for me and my family members to just sit and talk and have no where to go. We can go to the zoo since I never went and I would love to bond with my family members especially if its somewhere I never went before. My family members and I could have a cook out or I can just sleepover a friends house.

In conclusion, I would love to visit Ethiopia because my family and friends are there since i've missed so much while I was in America. I'd love to breathe the fresh air and eat the fresh food my grandma makes. Plus I would love to run around the backyard with my frirends.","
Task: Research the current events in Ethiopia over the past three years and analyze how they have impacted the author's life and relationships with family and friends.","
For the past three years, Ethiopia has experienced many changes in its political and social climate. In 2018, the country experienced a peaceful revolution that saw Prime Minister Hailemariam Dessalegn resign from his position and a new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed take office. His policies of openness, decentralization, and economic reform have fostered unprecedented economic growth and improved foreign relations. The gains made by the new government, however, have not been universal and tensions remain between some ethnic groups.

The changes in Ethiopia have had a profound effect on my life and relationships with family and friends. As an Ethiopian born and raised abroad, I have found it difficult to keep up with the rapid changes in the country that affect the lives of those back home. I have been more reconnected to my culture now more than ever before, however, as more of my friends and family have felt emboldened to share their stories and experiences. There is a renewed sense of pride in the Ethiopian community, and this has helped build closer bonds with friends and family in Ethiopia and abroad."
6253F73FBABF,"As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you.

Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again.

If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them.

In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it.

be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person.

Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things.

Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are.

being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you.

could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

62654020C48D,"Are you one of the students that is home schooled? If not, here are some of the benefits, why some students choose to attend classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.

Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.

Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.","
Task: Research the benefits of attending classes by the way of online or video conferencing for homeschooled students. Explore the topics of safety, focus, and avoiding bad influence from others.","
Online and video conferencing classes have become increasingly popular for students who are being homeschooled. Not only do these classes provide convenience, they also offer safety, improved focus, and the assurance of avoiding bad influences from others. 

Many parents who homeschool their children struggle to provide them in-person educational opportunities, especially with the already reduced resources available to homeschooled students. Online and video conferencing classes allow homeschooled students to access a variety of classes, often from the comfort and safety of their own home. This reduces the worrying parents often have about their children being exposed to bad influences outside of home. 

Additionally, online classes provide a level of focus that can be hard to replicate in a traditional classroom setting. Without the distractions of other students or teachers, the student is able to stay focused on the content and work more efficiently. When it comes to a homeschooled student, this concentrated form of learning is especially beneficial, as it can enhance their academic skills and levels of understanding. 

All in all, online and video conferencing classes are ideal for homeschooled students. Whether it be for safety, focus, or to avoid bad influences, these classes can be a great asset to any homeschooling curriculum."
6269A525D482,"I think it is a good idea because students might be tired of working at school everyday. Lets say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round schools, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc...

First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if we don't then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone that's okay if you want.

Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because we don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay with our family because they love you so much and they want to spend time with you too.

Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat , go to mall, watch a movie etc...

In conclusion, We must spend time with family and friends to go anywhere in the world for a vacation. We can enjoy each other by going to a amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories. We need to be together as a family, work as a team, having fun on a vacation.

When it comes to taking a break from the everyday grind of work and studies, having longer holidays, a year-round school schedule, and more frequent breaks from school offer countless benefits. While some families may enjoy the structure that a yearly school schedule provides, the benefits of having longer school holidays and more frequent breaks can’t be overlooked. Taking a breather from work and studies provides an opportunity to relax and reset, relieving stress and allowing one to be more productive. 

For families, the options for vacation and activities are endless. From going to the pool or amusement park to having family movie night or picnicking in the park, each activity presents a unique opportunity for families to spend quality time with each other. People estimate that taking a vacation can reduce the chance of a heart attack by a whopping 50 percent, while also cutting down on stress and reducing the risk of depression. Taking a break and having fun also give families the chance to strengthen relationships, increasing trust, communication, and understanding.

62B3C9C3398E,"Do we have to live other people experiences?

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know. Fight for what you really want no matter what comes next.","
Task: Write an essay exploring the question ""Do we have to live other people's experiences?""","
No matter how hard we try, it is impossible for us to have the exact same life experiences that someone else has had. Every single one of us has our own individual path through life that gives us a unique perspective of the world around us. While the circumstances that brought us to this moment are different, they have shaped us and created the people we are today. 

When it comes to living other people's experiences, the answer isn't a simple yes or no. We can empathize with someone else's story, and feel similar emotions as them. We might have the same emotion from a similar situation, even if it didn't happen to us, but it's never going to be the exact same. We may also observe and learn from the experiences of other people, and take what we learn and apply it in our own life. However, the experience won't be the exact same, since we haven't actually lived it first-hand. 

Ultimately, we have to create our own life experiences and explore what this world has to offer. While we can observe and learn from the experiences of others, we must also embrace our own journey through life and make the most of it. As the saying goes, “you’ll never know till you try”. While we can understand other people's life stories, we will never experience them in the same way. It's ok to take ideas or lessons from their experiences, but in the end, we all have to create our own unique path."

Base on your experience, I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo because he is trying to convince us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow.

Is it important to know if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. For example, if we want to invest our money in something that is very expensive and we do not have a lot money to pay it but we insist to invest in that we are not going to get ahead. Another example is, when is almost time to pay bills we have to save money to pay them.

Because he is trying to convice us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo. Thank you for considering my ideas regarding.","
Task: 

Research the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson regarding the importance of thinking before doing in order to grow. Explore the implications of this in the context of financial decision-making. Provide examples and discuss how this concept can be applied in daily life.","
Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ""In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."" This is a reminder to stop and think before we do something, for in doing so we open a wealth of possibilities that spark creativity and innovation. When it comes to financial decision-making, this is critical: taking the time to research and analyze the different options available is important in order to make the best choice. 

For example, when deciding whether to take out a loan for a house or a car, careful thoughts must be given in order to determine which option is the best. Additionally, investing in stocks or mutual funds must likewise be carefully considered since there is always a risk of losing money if the wrong financial decisions are made.

This concept of thinking before doing is equally applicable to other aspects of daily life. Before making a purchase, people can explore different ways of getting the item they need, such as looking for discounts and coupons or buying used. In relationships, it helps to take a step back and thoughtfully consider our feelings and actions before responding to difficult situations. In any scenario, taking the time to think before jumping into a decision leads to better outcomes."
62E5030D1A59,"Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.","
Task: 
1. Research the Course Election process.
2. Learn about JROTC and similar military-like programs.
3. Search for examples of successful people acquiring the jobs they intended to work for.
4. Understand the impact of planning on our lives and consider potential plans for planning future goals.
5. Learn about the importance of gaining experience in order to understand a desired job.
6. Understand the advantages of taking the time to think about what field a","
Every year, millions of people around the world exercise their right to elect their leaders through the democratic process. As citizens, it is our duty to understand the ins and outs of the election process to ensure that we make informed decisions. Similarly, it is important to have an understanding of JROTC and similar military-like programs. Knowing the pros and cons of these great programs can help us better decide if they are right for us.

We can also look to many successful people for guidance and motivation when trying to reach our career goals. Researching these stories and seeing how they achieved their goals can be very beneficial in our own pursuits. Along the same line, it is important to understand the impact of planning in our lives, and take time to come up with a plan that will guide us towards our desired objective.

Finally, obtaining experience in the field is essential if you want to understand it and eventually work in it. Taking the time to make sure you are properly informed and well-experienced can make all the difference. All in all, by doing your research and taking the time to consider your plan for the future, you can be well on your way to acquiring the job you intended to work for."
62EA3F855DB2,"It is a better choice asking more than one person because when you ask them what's your problem or question most of them are going to say something else while some are just going to say the same thing. But it's not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person. Because that person might be wrong and not know ask your examples:mom,dad,ant,uncle your friends anyone you trust and thats how you get multiple opinions and when your making a better choice by asking anyone you know. But don't ask one person cause one that person might not know and two it's not a better choice by asking only one person and sometimes you might not trust that one person by his or it's idea. And you might get your problem or question answered by asking multiple of people. Conclusion that you should ask more than one person so you can get more multiple opinions and you might get the right answer of your problem or question by the right person. But some people don't like telling other people there question or problem one cause there scared or shy or they might think that the person will not know or understand what the person is talking about that sometimes can happened it happen to my friend once where he had a math question asked the teacher but the teacher didn't know what he meant or what he was talking about so the teacher tryed to tell him his question but that wasnt the question my friend ask for so he told a student that sits next to him and he understanded what he was talking about so he then helped him with the question he had.","
    Task: Investigate the benefits of asking more than one person when seeking opinions and advice. Consider asking family members, friends, teachers, and other trusted people to compare their responses and expertise. Analyze the potential risks and disadvantages of seeking advice from a single source. Finally, explain a situation you have experienced in which you asked more than one person for help in resolving an issue.","
    When it comes to seeking advice or opinions, it is always beneficial to consult more than one person. Consulting multiple sources of knowledge and experience can provide different perspectives and better inform the decision-making process. Additionally, relying on a more diverse base of sources can help to mitigate the risk of bias and reduce the possibility of making a bad decision. On the other hand, if advice is only being sought from a single source, they may lack the breadth of knowledge needed. Furthermore, the advice from one single person also contains the potential of being biased, as they may have their own personal agenda and motivations.

Recently, I was considering starting my own business and needed some advice. I decided to ask family members, friends, and colleagues who had been successful entrepreneurs and gathered their advice based on their experiences. After taking the time to listen to everyone’s opinion, I was able to make a more informed and well-rounded decision on which path to pursue."
62EDBC22A953,"I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone.

Success are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed.

The important role of failures on success is that, if you don't fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right.

Now, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. I'll say, once my aunt told me ""Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on"", she hasn't never give up on what she can achieve in her life. For example I'm from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born.

There was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself ""You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you"". I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesn't mean nothing for me. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed.

Failures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.

Some people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.

More than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.","
Task: Analyze how failure can contribute to success and how it can help develop a better life. Discuss how failures can cause a decrease of hope, enthusiasm and faith, and provide evidence of how failure can be used as motivation to succeed. Additionally, provide an example of why success does not always come from failing.","
Failure is an important yet often uncomfortable part of life. It can cause a decrease of hope, enthusiasm and faith and make people feel like their efforts are futile. However, failure can also be used to motivate people to succeed. By understanding the mistakes made and reflecting on how to do better in the future, we can build up our resilience and prepare for future challenges. 

For instance, a student who has failed a test may take time to analyze the mistakes they made and use this to focus their future efforts. This forward-thinking can help the student develop the persistence and determination to succeed. However, success does not always come from failing. It is important to strive for success on the path up to it, as well as learn the lessons from mistakes along the way. Successful results can come from being diligent and methodical in any endeavor."

4. Evaluate how to limit the negative effects of technology.","

In the 21st century, technology has drastically changed the way humans communicate and interact with each other. Access to laptops, tablets, and smartphones have made it easier and faster to communicate with others, which has proven to be both a positive and a negative aspect of technology. On one hand, communication has become more efficient with the ability to instantly get in touch with anyone, anytime. On the other hand, spending too much time on technology can lead to reduced social interaction and even vision problems, due to the reliance on screens. 

Additionally, technology has had a major impact on libraries and their role in society. As the majority of people now have access to digital books and other forms of media on the internet, fewer people visit libraries. Librarians have had to adapt to this changing trend and redirect their attention to providing other services such as educational programs, or hosting events like music performances.

Considering the negative effects of increased technology usage, it is important to limit the time spent on technology and find a healthy balance. It can be helpful to set boundaries and limit the amount of time spent on screens daily. Additionally, we should give ourselves the chance to connect with others face to face, as meaningful interactions are fundamental for our social development."

To truly understand what thee author is trying to is saying you must understand that to say that you have mastered something is to be able to do it without failer. In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achiving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confodince you can reach mastery.

6305A432AB38,"The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude.

It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. The importance of having a positive attitude can be bigger of what some people may think.

A positive attitude is the key to success in life because a positive attitude will help not to give up and will make things easier.

First, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because being positive help no to give up. For example, in the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities"", many people had a hard time before becoming successful. Even though, that people had adversities they always had a positive attitude towards the problems, that hope they needed to become someone. A positive attitude can change the view of the problems. Having a good attitude help people to not give up when facing adversities.

Furthermore, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier. For example, a person with a positive attitude will always see the good side of the problems. When people have a good attitude toward a problem, to face it becomes easier since people will look for a solution instead of being stuck. The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life.

Many people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life.

To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through. People with a good attitude do not give up when facing problems. Having a good attitude, will make things easier to go through.

Examine how a positive attitude helps not to give up when facing challenges. Research how a positive attitude makes things easier and how it helps people to become successful. Explore arguments about whether a positive attitude is necessary to be successful. Summarize the importance of having a good attitude in life.","
Having a good attitude in life is strongly associated to success and resilience when facing challenging situations. Studies have shown that having a positive outlook on life can help us overcome adversity, and can ultimately lead to success. It increases our capabilities to see opportunity, rather than danger, in the face of failure. Moreover, research has shown that having a positive attitude can make it easier to focus on tasks and circumvent negative emotions. Positive thinking makes it easier to view a problem as a challenge, instead of an obstacle. 

Despite these advantages, there is a debate about whether having a positive attitude is necessary for success. There is evidence that hard work, resilience, and talent are all equally important to attaining success. Nonetheless, having a positive attitude in life greatly increases the chances of achieving both short-term goals and long-term objectives. 

In summary, having a good attitude is an important factor for becoming successful and achieving your goals. It gives us the courage to face difficult situations and helps us to channel our energy into productive tasks. With a positive attitude we can reach our potential and achieve our ambitions."
631F9CBDFD7A,"Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner.

63314DE11287,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.

Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day.

If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.

Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.

Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow.

The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.","

3. Find at least one example from everyday life where people learn new skills and knowledge.
4. Analyze the importance of education in helping to discover what you really enjoy or are truly passionate about.
5. Explore the idea of pushing yourself further despite already","
In today's world, it is of paramount importance to continue to learn new skills and information, both for success and personal growth. Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized the significance of this by noting, “Life is a journey, not a destination.” His message is that knowledge is obtained through the journey of life, and only through continual learning can one reach their goals. 

This concept is evident in everyday life. For example, individuals from all walks of life may take a class to learn a new skill, such as a coding language or baking. By engaging in such activities, people are able to gain knowledge while also expanding their interests and gaining insight into what they enjoy.

Education is key when it comes to discovering new passions. Researchers have long noted the importance of education in discovering new interests and hobbies. Studies have found that the more time individuals spend with their studies, the more likely they are to discover talents and interests they were previously unaware of. Furthermore, it is these activities one learns through their studies that eventually lead to a career or pursuit one is passionate about.

Therefore, it is essential to continuously push yourself further in life, despite what you have already accomplished. By engaging in learning activities, individuals not only prevent stagnation, but also open themselves to a variety of opportunities that can lead to personal growth and success."

So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in today's society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. I don't agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever.

It is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. In today's generation with all the social media we have people that have been rude and comment someting bad to make you feel bad about yourself and then some people change themself just because of a comment that could hurt someone. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself.

Also being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs.

In my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation. Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back.

So just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it is'nt you. It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they would'nt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them. ","
Task: Write an essay discussing whether the greatest accomplishment in the world is being yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are.","
In a world of constant pressure to conform, it can be difficult to truly be oneself. Our society is constantly trying to change us, to mold us into the people that it prefers. But is this a successful pursuit? Ultimately, is the greatest accomplishment in the world being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are?

To understand the answer to this question, it is important to look at the meaning behind being oneself. Being oneself is more than just the physical attributes that make up a person’s identity. It is about understanding who you are, and accepting it, even if that means going against the common norm. Being able to stand up for one’s beliefs, no matter how unpopular they may be, is a key part of being oneself. To be true to oneself in a world that is trying to change you is a major accomplishment.

It takes courage and conviction to stay true to oneself in the face of opposition. Doing so shows that not only have you accepted yourself, but that you are capable of standing up for something you believe in. In addition, it can be educational and inspiring to those that may follow a similar path. It may give them the confidence to follow the path of self-acceptance and discovery.

At the end of the day, though being oneself in a world constantly trying to change the person you are can be a daunting task, it is a great accomplishment that should be celebrated. To understand and accept oneself is a powerful thing, and it should be recognized and its power should be recognized. The greatest accomplishment in the world can be being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are."
63AB55DADABF,"Do you think we should extend our school day? No, I think we shouldn't extend the time because we already get enough learning and our classes are long. I also don't think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school.

We get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers won't really know what to do. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. I don't think its fair for elementray because they stay in their classes the entire day . It would be very broring because they are going to be sitting there for eight and a half hour. It would be very broing for them, because they don't get to switch classes like middle and highschool. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldn't just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. They really can't do anything after school is done.

If we extend the time in school we will be at school later. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They wont pay attention to class because they didn't get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. We will also be getting home late. Elementray kids will be getting home around 5:00pm. They won't be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They will be tired because they don't get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. They also can't do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. They will get home late and they can't do much because they will have to focus on homework and school.

Extending the time could be harder for bus drivers. Bus drivers need enough sleep so that they can drive the students safely to school. Sleep is the most important and you should get at least eight hours of sleep, and that can't be possible for bus drivers because they will get home late. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. If they don't get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. Crashes could happen if it's too dark and the bus drivers can't see outside. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isn't good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. They also won't get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. Crashes aren't good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldn't really see outside.

I dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know. What do you think should we add one and a half hour to our school day?         ","
Task: Write an essay expressing your opinion on whether or not the school day should be extended by one and a half hours. Consider the effects it could have on students, drivers, and teachers.","

In my opinion, extending the school day by one and a half hours is a bad idea. The additional time would place an undue burden on students, drivers, and teachers. For students, the extra time spent in the classroom would leave less time for homework, activities, and family time; all of which contribute to physical and mental health. For drivers, it would mean more kids on the road during rush hour, potentially leading to dangerous situations and delays. Finally, for teachers, it would mean longer days with more lesson plans to create and teach. 

All in all, I think that extending the school day is not a good idea. It could lead to dangerous and negative situations for students, drivers, and teachers alike. There are better ways to improve education that don't rely on cutting into the precious time students have for other activities."

Task: Write an essay disagreeing with the idea that one's first impression is the most important when getting to know someone else.","
My first impression of someone may not be particularly accurate. Societal norms and expectations, personal biases, or even the way someone is dressed can all affect our initial opinion. It is impossible to get a full perspective of someone’s character, personality, or values just by first impressions. People can be much more complex than we give them credit for, and sometimes it takes a second, or even a third, look to get a better idea of who they are. 

Although first impressions can be helpful in some situations, forming too strong of an opinion or judgement based off of minimal information can be hazardous. People should take their own time in getting to know someone's decency, intelligence, and overall character before assuming they shaped the complete, accurate picture. 

Overall, it is a mistake to think that our first impressions are the most important when getting to know somebody. We should leave room for change, understanding, and growth in getting to know someone, and not rely solely on surface-level features."

Task: Write an essay about the importance of being true to yourself despite pressure from society and expectations of family.","
When faced with the expectations of society and family, it can be easy to lose sight of yourself in the process. In today’s world, it is increasingly important to stay true to yourself, no matter how much pressure is applied. Being true to yourself has the potential to provide numerous benefits, such as improved overall well-being and a sense of personal meaning. 

When you remain true to yourself, even when it conflicts with external influences, you will be able to feel more confident and in control of your life. You will find yourself surrounded by people that accept and respect you for who you are. You will find that when you stand up for yourself and refuse to compromise who you are for the sake of others, you will experience a newfound sense of self-empowerment. 

It is understandable to feel caught between the expectations of society and family. It can be overwhelming to know that you're constantly being judged and pressurized. The choices we make in such situations can be difficult, but it is important to remember that in the end, your sense of self is what really matters. If you stay true to your identity and goals in life, you will be able to live your best life. 

So take a stand and stay true to yourself. When you say “no” to outside expectations and pressures, you will gain social and personal empowerment, and eventually, self-confidence. True happiness and a sense of purpose will follow."
63C74FF7DB27,"Take learning distance on home is not good ideas . first reason is not the same to take on school. when we going schools we have more option to learning. sometime when we don't undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times.

The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant.

Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping.

In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant.  ","
Task: Compare and contrast distance learning and attending classes at school. Provide examples for support and a conclusion.","
Distance learning and attending classes at school both have their benefits and drawbacks.  Distance learning, such as online coursework, can allow for more flexibility in terms of when and where instruction is completed. It can also allow students to engage with course material on their own terms, taking more or less time as needed for understanding. However, online courses are often more self-directed, and as such may require that students have strong self-discipline or adequate support to ensure that the material is correctly completed.

Attending classes at school still offers its advantages, such as personal engagement with teachers and peers, as well as having fixed end-points to curriculum: namely semesters or quarters. In the classroom, teachers are available to help guide students with any issues they encounter, and the structure of the classroom serves to facilitate focus on mastering material. That said, the physical limitations of attending classes can also paint a challenge for students who have to work around a set school schedule, and who may not always be able to attend or complete their coursework in-person.

In conclusion, there are advantages and drawbacks to each system of learning—distance learning can offer more freedom in terms of when and how to engage with course material, while attending classes can offer more structure and personal connection with a teacher. Ultimately, the choice of system may depend on an individual's personal needs and learning style."
63E2278271E4,"The British john Lubbock wrote 'your character will be what you yourself choose to make it'

there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they dont fell good about them selves and have a lot of thinking inside of them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i dont think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control.

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives.

Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.

There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in.

There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

Our characters are shaped by a variety of influences, both external and internal. We are influenced by the people we interact with and the environment around us, as well as by our own personal thoughts and feelings. These influences are often outside of our control, and can profoundly affect our development. Even our genetics and upbringing can shape who we become, something we have no control over. Despite this, I still believe that it is possible for people to choose their own path if they are determined enough to do so. There are countless examples of individuals who have overcome difficult situations and created lives for themselves that exemplify strength and perseverance. This brings me hope for our world today, and while some aspects may seem dire, I have faith that we can create a better future if we can strive to do better and be the change we wish to see."
6418C102917D,"In cartoon sponge bob square pants sponge bob he say's "" imagination"" as to us is inferring for us to use our imagination, like no matter how old you are what disabilities you have is inferring to everyone ,But do you ever think imagination is important than knowledge?

Beginning,with this statement i agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as an other parent would probably say to your child "" your child has a big imagination "". And imagination will always be apart of us we grew up having our little or big imagination's how do you think we would imagine us in the future or like some other examples: how we want to wear out clothes, what type of clothes we wanna wear, what design we want on our cake, or and how we imagine unicorns, ninjas,or any of those type of things ,and superheros. without imagination we wouldnt know about that or the sense of knowing what that is.

Also,

having imagination is also good because were not always gonna use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is,for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind person's life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you wanna know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when there walking down the street or when buying clothes,There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it,or they imagine were this thing is or that thing.

In conclusion, i agree with this statement "" imagination is more important than knowledge "" because for those given reasons like the one about us as kids we would use our imagination and how we would use it for ourselves and the other given example for the blind people how they have that throughout there life spam. therefore those are my reasons i agree with the given statement.","
Task: Write an essay exploring why imagination is more important than knowledge. Consider examples such as when children use their imagination, or how the blind are able to rely on imagination.","

Imagination can provide a solution to the unanswerable, can turn obstacles into opportunities, and can create a path where none existed before. Imagination is essential, both in our personal as well as our professional lives, because it enables us to cast aside the limits of knowledge and see the bigger picture.

Take, for instance, a young child. Children are able to use their imagination in amazing ways, to conjure up stories, pictures or objects of their own making. Parents and educators often praise this sort of creative thinking, as it allows the child to take risks free from the anxiety of being wrong. 

More importantly, imagination can be used to bridge gaps for the differently-abled. For the blind, for example, it is not knowledge that might help a person find his or her way, but rather the ability to imagine one's surroundings. It is imagination that allows them to visualise a street corner or a store, and to traverse a path that may have been previously unknown. 

In conclusion, imagination is considered more important than knowledge because it is far more versatile, powerful, and adaptive. It is the tool we need when knowledge fails us; it is the key to creative thinking; and it allows for a measure of flexibility and creativity that knowledge alone cannot offer."
6422237D967F,"Would you like someone deciding what's best for you or take matter into your own hands? Well in my opinion people should make there own decisions because they can decide how they want things and what makes them happy in there own way even though some would argue that, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some times they know whats best for us and our own health. Yes, sometimes when you seek for guidance they help you out a lot and lead you to the right path. They also, help you find whats happy but its not like if your doing it because you want your just doing it to better yourself and your not doing what you want your doing what your told.

Deciding what u want probably is what's best since your going at your own paste, your taking it how you want. your going at your own paste with things. Also, no one can stop you from doing what you believe is best for you. You can find your own ways to cope with things without anyone telling you other wise. Going at your own pace is better then getting rushed, doing what you dont want, and doing what your told even. However, getting help pushes you to do it better.

Seeking guidance isnt bad at all either you get the help you need, you get that push forward to bettering yourself. Sometimes in life there are moments where your not your best help and you need a hand. Theres nothing ever wrong with getting a little help. You sometimes need a hand to understand your values to get to recognize them and meet them.

we all have different life matters because we all dont care about the same thing. we all care about different things. your life important matters are valuable and there something that only you can decide on not any one else.

2. List the values and life matters most important to you and why. 
3. Write a comparison between making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts.
4. Summarize why making your own decisions is important for you and why.","
When it comes to making decisions, many of us grapple with the question of whether to go it alone or to seek guidance from those more experienced.  On the one hand, seeking professional advice can provide us with the specialized expertise necessary to tackle complicated situations.  On the other hand, making one’s own decisions can provide a sense of independence and self-ownership.  

For me, I value both my liberty and security.  I value my freedom to be independent and make decisions that reflect my own interests, and I also recognize the importance of maintaining a sense of safety and stability. As such, it’s important for me to strike a balance between trusting my instincts and trusting the wisdom of experts.

Making one’s own decisions is particularly important when it comes to matters of personal values.  No one knows me better than I know myself, so I’m well aware of the values and life matters that are most important to me.  With that being said, when it comes to more complicated or technical matters, I believe it's wise to seek counsel from professionals to ensure I make the best possible decisions.

In the end, it's up to me to choose between making my own decisions or seeking expert guidance.  Ultimately, whether I decide to go it alone or take advantage of the wisdom of others, I am responsible for the outcome.  That's why, in the end, I must always trust my own instincts and values when making decisions that will impact my life."
642CB997325C,"Working Beyond

Do you need to work beyond what you have mastered to grow? Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience.

Many people grow by trying new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. In addition people will get better at what they do. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings.

Many people may succeed when they try new things. People will become more successful. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. In addition they will know their way around. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better.

Finally people gain more experience. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. People will be more educated in that topic and help others.

While many people think you can not grow. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

In conclusion people who go above and beyond grow because they have done more to help them grow and become better and to succeed. You should try and go beyond and see if you grown.             ","

Pushing yourself beyond your current level of mastery is essential to achieving true success. When you take the initiative to go beyond a skill already mastered, you open yourself up to new opportunities, gain new perspectives, and build a portfolio of experiences that can help you stand out from the crowd. With each challenge successfully completed, you gain a greater understanding of yourself, strengthen your existing skills, and develop new ones. There is no way to move forward without taking risks, and the only way to expand your boundaries and find new success is by taking the initiative to research and try something new and difficult."
642E44E8DD25,"I would like to visit a engineering work place, or company. I would like to learn all about planning how do build something, and to they come up with good building ideas. What is the most hard part that a engineer has to take very series?.

If i was able do visit one of these companies i would get very happy. My mom told me that this is a good job, but it's a risk that people that want to have this job have to take in order do get pay very well. One of my teacher in Generic_School his dad was a engineer he told me that his dad didn't like math because it was to hard, but he got a job in the engineering company and he good checks. This teacher that i'm talking about didn't like science, or math and at the end he ended up teaching math, and science he is very good at it, and a very nice teacher too. I think all of this that i talked about is teaching me that i need to have good grades in my prealgebra class.

Engineering for me is easy do say, but i wanna experience does hard problems. On Saturdays and Sundays i work with my dad. My dads lets me cut the grass and it not easy, he keeps telling me to get good grades, so i don't have be like him all day in those hot days. I guess that working all day in a very hot summer is not food. My dad taught me that working under the sun is very hard a it makes your back hurt he told me that i need to be better them him. When i'm older i would get a good job, and i would help my dad, and my mom even dough they told me that when get older they are going to go back to El Salvador , but i'm still going to help them.

I think that i would give engineering a chance if not i'm going to find another job. thats ones of my job, or company i would like to visit if it was close to my school. Another company, or job would be frying airplanes i is good job i o ways wanted to fly one, but its do hard plus i don't think i'm going to go to college i think that this jobs are just to hard for me to learn especially me it take a long time for me to remember something. I think i can make it if only i put mu effort on it. My teachers tell me that i'm smart only when i want to, they o ways tell me to give it a try and i o ways ended up learning it sometimes i think that teachers sometimes understand students and hoe they feel. I get mad when don't understand something. i haven't done good in 7, and 8th grade. I think that all of these happen because i made new friends. I think that flying airplanes is much harder then learning engineering, but the only thing i need to do if put my effort in everything

I think that is not a bad idea do have some company around schools they should make field trips, kids could ask question that they would like to ask.

Research engineering jobs, their requirements and the skills needed. Analyze the day to day tasks of an engineer and the potential benefits of the job. Explore the challenges associated with obtaining and maintaining these engineering jobs. Investigate success stories of engineers and identify the qualities that helped them reach success.

    For many of us, the thought of becoming an engineer is equal parts intimidating and exciting. Growing up, I knew that I had potential to become a successful engineer, but I had to commit to a rigorous educational pursuit and develop important skills in order to succeed. After extensive research, I found engineering jobs could vary greatly in terms of qualifications and tasks, but one common requirement was the need to have certain technical skills. To me, this was both a challenge and a potential advantage; while developing the necessary skills required a lot of hard work, I also realized that I could use my technical knowledge to pursue a highly rewarding and fulfilling career.

I soon found that engineering jobs weren’t just filled with complex tasks: there were also multiple benefits. From financial stability to a sense of accomplishment, engineering jobs allowed me to use my intellect in unique ways. Through these jobs, I was able to learn valuable lessons in both practical and theoretical aspects of my chosen field. I was also reminded of the importance of organizational and problem-solving skills, which are essential for any successful engineer.

While I had my own experiences with engineering, one of the most motivational things I did was to explore success stories of engineers as well. Reading about famous engineers and their accomplishments provided me with a newfound appreciation and respect for the profession. I was also inspired by their perseverance and adaptability, which I found to be the key qualities required for being successful in the field of engineering. In hindsight, I agree that the challenges I faced were worth it; the time and effort put into learning key skills and tasks paid off, as I now have a fulfilling engineering job that I enjoy."

64A8183557F7,"Should students graduate in three years?

Some school offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years. Students should graduate in three years because, they have more time planing what they want to do, they have more time to work and save money for college and they have more time to spend time with their family. To have ideas who they can do during that year.

Students should graduate from High school in three years because, some students don't know what career they want or they don't know if work or continue studying. In that year they can think and choose what they want. One of my friends graduated the last year of school and she stay at home because she doesn't know what career choose, so she just stay at home because she doesn't know what to study and can't find a job yet.

Some students after four years in High School, they take one year more to think and relax at home. That is why i think is a good idea just three years of High School. They can take that year to work and save money for college, if they want to. They can just start work to adapt to their new life or new thing that are going to learn. In a fact, student can graduate in three years of High School because is better for them. I think is better because it help those student that are more than eighteen to graduate not too old.

Some people think that students should not graduate from High school in three years because, they have less time, but they are wrong because, students can take the most important classes or they can take classes in the evenings. Some students take courses during the summers. Some students want to graduate early because have some goals that they want to complete. In the future there can be online classes for those who need extra classes.

In conclusion, graduate from High school in three years is a good idea because, students can start college or the work force one year early. Students have more time to search a good college and to prepare their thing. This is good for parents too because, they can go to the college that their son or daughter wants to go.  ","

On the one hand, students who manage to complete all of their required coursework in less time can start college earlier. This can also mean saving on the cost of courses and room and board. On the other hand, for many students, there is a need to mature and gain some life experience after their high school years, so rushing into college may not be the best option.

In the end, whether or not graduating from high school in three years is the right choice for a student should be considered on an individual basis. There are numerous factors to consider, from academic readiness to social development, and each student must evaluate if this approach will help them reach their academic and personal goals."
64A9ECB1C55A,"Have you ever thought about asking other people for advice? Perhaps, people sometimes talk to more than one person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next step, and that person will stop thinking about their choice too much.

FIrstly, the person will be able to know which one is the best choice to go with. I have exprienced it when I make a wrong choice. One time, I planned to clean the car. Than, I asked my parents about it, and they said that You should not clean the car because there is a lot of different diseases that are in the car. I said to myself that my parents are right because I can be sick, tired, and can have different kinds of diseases. Then, I decided that I will not going to clean the car. It is better to ask advise from the people that are your friend or family. Moreover, it will help you to make better choice in your life. One time, I decided to play video games with my friend, and I actually had a test after that day. My friend just ask me that if I have a test. I told him that yes I do have test tomorrow, then he give me an advice that you should not play any video games tonight because video games can make you tired, bored, and can't think about your question in the test. When I thinked to myslef that if I play video games, I will not be able to think on my test the next day of it. I recommend to ask good people fo an advice.

Secondly, the person will find their next step. I have exprience that when I don't find my next step, I would ask for advice from other people. Once, I did not know how to do my next step my math assighnment. I asked my friend that should I multiplie or add, she showed me a trick for an easier way to always find your step when you are stuck on that kind of question. I likly use that trick trick, and I mostly find my step. I recommend that a person will have to ask for advice if they even know the answer. In addition, there was a time that my sister had a problem with her next step. It was an important assighnment so I did'nt help her but, I give some advices and that helped her a lot to, fix her step thet she was stuck. I will say that a person should ask people for an advice.

Lastly, the person will stop thinking about their choice too much. I have expreinced it when I think about my choice so much. Once, I had a choice that I could take the Mock writing SOL or I could get the original and a higher level writing SOL. I always thinked which one should I go for, and one day I was angry for no reason and that was because of how much I thinked about which one I should go with. I asked my dad about this and he said that you should take the original because this is a challenge for you. Additionally, I said to myslef that if I get this writing SOL and if I pass this, my parents ahould give at least a gift and I said to my dad that this challenge is great. Again, I recommend people to ask advice from someone to know and research more about something.

In conclusion, people somtimes talk to more than on person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next direction, and that person will have to extract his thinking about their choice too much. Consenquently, I would always recommend to ask an advice from a person you know or knows the best.","
Task: Consider asking advice from other people before making important decisions. Write a short essay exploring three common reasons why advice should be sought. Use personal experiences to illustrate each point.","
Seeking advice from trusted sources when making important decisions is a wise course of action. I have personally sought and followed advice that has yielded both good and bad results, providing me with valuable insight on why it should be sought. 

The first reason why advice should be sought is that it can provide different perspectives. When I was choosing which college to attend, I sought advice from my parents, my teachers, and peers, which gave me many different opinions and viewpoints on the best choice. Each individual had different experiences and advice that helped me make a better decision.

The second reason why advice should be sought is to get guidance on difficult decisions. For example, when deciding whether to start my own business, I asked financial advisors, mentors, and entrepreneurs who had extensive knowledge and experience in the field. Their advice on both the risks and potential rewards of launching my own business helped to inform my decision.

The third reason why advice should be sought is to get help developing plans and strategies. Before embarking on a big project, I often consult other people who have done similar projects before. Their advice has proved invaluable in helping me plan out a step-by-step process for success.

Overall, consulting trusted sources for advice is an important part of making informed decisions. Personal experiences I have had have provided me with undeniable proof of the value of seeking advice, and I will continue to use this useful resource in all of my important decisions."
64AE19BBA321,"A problem is a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because of many reasons, first reason why I agree is it never will solve the problem if you don't try to at least do it, second reason is that you feel more competitive to face the problem, the last reason is that your friends and family can help you a lot with the problem.

If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. If you don't do anything about the problem it is going to effect your life even more. So you might as will do all you can to do something good that can solve the problem. For example someone comes and bullies you everyday, and if you dont do anything about that then its gonna get worse and worse everyday.

When you see a problem getting in your way of accomplishing your goals, you should always stand up for your self and face the problem, and beat the problem so it can never bother you again. Their are many you have to face during your life for example, if there is a someone that always bothers you or bullies you, you should do something about it.

If you had a problem face you there probably someone that helped you a little to solve it. Its always really important to tell a friend or a family whats going on in your life because it always makes you feel better. The reason why it makes you feel better is because when your saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it. For example if a bully starts to beat you up then the only people that can help you is family and friends.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. This statement is a really good statement because it really motivates people to face there problems, and get them out of there way. I agreed to this statement because of all the reasons I was talking about in the other paragraphs.","

Learning how to deal with stressful situations and difficult problems can be hard. However, it is essential in order to face and solve them in a productive and healthy way. 

Here are some tips and advice on how to face and solve problems:

- Take a step back and assess the situation objectively—gaining a better understanding of the problem can help define the steps needed to fix it.
- Break the problem into smaller steps—accomplishing smaller tasks can be less overwhelming and lead to the bigger picture. 
- Ask for help—telling a friend or family member about a problem can help to ease the burden and create a plan of action.

For example, being bullied is a difficult life problem that can be solved. It’s important to talk to a trusted adult like a teacher, parent, or guidance counselor to address the issue. If the problem is already out of hand, consider contacting the authorities for help. 

Facing and solving this problem can have many beneficial outcomes. It can bring an increased sense of self-confidence and self- worth, to know that the problem has been handled and no longer has control over your life. It can also provide a newfound appreciation for the people that supported you and helped to end the bullying. 

It is essential to tell a friend or family about a problem in order to be met with support and helpful advice. A problem shared is a problem halved, as the old saying goes, and oftentimes it can help to speak about it with someone that can offer guidance. Knowing that you aren’t alone and that someone is there with you can give the strength you need to handle any difficult problem."

But we use a phone to call them if their fine and we talk them about our life. Even tho were fary away them we still communicat with them. ","
Task: Write an essay comparing the pros and cons of technology in regards to communication, research, and gaming.","
Technology has changed the way we communicate, research, and game. On one hand, its use has made information more accessible and enabled us to communicate faster and more efficiently. For example, social media platforms allow people from around the world to connect and share content instantly. Research can now be done online, and searching for data is far quicker and more convenient than ever before. Gaming has also become all the more immersive and interactive with the help of technology, and players can now enjoy a wider range of gaming experiences. 

On the other hand, technology can be a distraction for some people. For example, communication through social media can be superficial and lacks the personal interaction of face-to-face communication. The sheer amount of data available online can also be overwhelming, and it can be difficult to sieve through and verify all of the facts. Furthermore, some gaming platforms can be addictive and can quickly become more important to people than activities such as physical exercise or pursuing other hobbies.

64EB91C84A32,"Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

Online education has grown rapidly over the past decade, providing convenient and flexible opportunities for students to learn. By taking into account the diverse needs of students, educators can take advantage of online education to make up for missed school days due to personal, health, or sports considerations. Additionally, remote learning can ensure that students are not disadvantaged by weather-related cancellations, minimizing disruptions to schooling. 

In-person and online classrooms offer their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Time management is an important factor to consider; in online classrooms, students are often responsible for establishing their own study time, whereas an instructor can structure a traditional classroom to ensure that learning time is used efficiently. Furthermore, online learning can be less distracting, as students have more control over their environment. That said, online education can be lonely and isolating, as students miss out on conversations and collaborations with their peers. As such, it is important to weigh all potential factors before deciding between an online or in-person learning environment.

All in all, online education can meet a variety of needs, often allowing students to learn in a more flexible manner that suits their individual needs. With careful consideration of time management, distractions, and potential isolation, remote learning can be advantageous for students with missed school days or weather-related interruptions."

Task: Research ways in which everyday life in Puerto Rico is different from the US and El Salvador, such as food, clothing, customs, schooling, families, and discipline. Compare the differences and reflect on how they may impact the writer's attitude and outlook on life.","
When researching everyday life in Puerto Rico, El Salvador, and the United States, it is important to take into consideration the various customs, family dynamics, clothing, education, and discipline methods in each place. Generally, food in the United States is more processed and convenience-based than in Puerto Rico and El Salvador, where traditional, made-from-scratch, home-cooked meals are more common. Clothing in Puerto Rico ranges from everyday casual to formal, with a focus on traditional dress for special occasions, whereas in El Salvador clothing is more casual and the focus is more on practicality. In Puerto Rico and El Salvador, family is typically very central to life, while in the United States, families may have more distance between them. Educational values vary, as in Puerto Rico, families often prioritize education for their children, while in El Salvador, the focus is more on growing up quickly and with minimal schooling. Discipline also varies, with stricter structures in El Salvador and Puerto Rico, and more relaxed attitudes in the United States. 

Comparisons like this can help one reflect on their outlook on life and their place in the world. Life in different countries can offer insight into new ways of thinking and looking at the world, expanding one's horizons and experiences. Understanding the experiences of those around us can help us foster compassion, connection, and appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the human experience."

6515E6AFD11E,"Although some people don't agree with this quote for being negative,however others and I agree of the enthusiasm quote because to learn something new in life and to make mistakes for something great later.

Do you agree with the Former Prime Minister Of England Winston Churchill quote? There others take this quote in a positive way or in a negative way. People that have enthusiasm will most likely to take the quote to their own hearts that doesn't want to quit or gives up yet. Like the quote says from failure to failure that will follow up to a pursuit of success. So here comes the reasons of enthusiasm in the quote.

Learning something new that actually comes up great. A lot of people learn from their own failures in the past for doing something that wasn't easy for their own lives. Like example someone wants to speak a different language but failed many times,that actually doesn't wants to give up on the language that trying to learn. And it's better to make mistakes for something greater later in life. Like if you failed a lot and that you learn from your own mistakes from those mistakes will do something greater in the future.

Others may disagree that quote doesn't fit right their own selves and for being negative. Others careless about the enthusiasm how it will help for their lifetime. So they don't have the positive attitude and thinks about nothing at all. Negativity is the main point that they fail to fail without trying the best and the enthusiasm with them in life it's worthless to them in life.

Although some people don't agree with this quote for being negative,however others and I agree of the enthusiasm quote because to learn something new in life and to make mistakes for something great later.

Task:
Write an essay exploring your opinion on Former Prime Minister Of England Winston Churchill’s quote “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” Analyze both sides of the argument, including the positive and negative aspects of the quote and any personal experiences that illustrate the importance of the quote.","
Winston Churchill's quote ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"" is one of the most inspiring quotes of the modern era. On one hand, Churchill's quote highlights the fact that success, while valuable, is not static and there is always more to be done. This encourages individuals to strive for continuous improvement and progress in their lives. On the other hand, Churchill's quote isn't complete without addressing failure. To achieve success one must not be discouraged by failure, but to use it as a learning experience and keep going with determination and courage. 

I relate to this quote personally; when I was in graduate school, I struggled to keep up with my classes and often felt adrift. However, I used Churchill's words as a source of hope and motivation; regardless of my failures, I had the courage to push on and eventually graduate with much success. This quote spoke to me directly and showed me that failure was just a necessary step in the journey to success. 

Ultimately, Churchill's quote is a potent reminder that it is never too late to start again and to continue striving for excellence no matter the setbacks encountered. No matter how difficult the journey becomes, the courage and determination to continue will allow one to eventually reach their goals."

And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing. Thus i something else is the greatest accomplishment. ""The world needs me"". if ","
Task:
Create an essay that addresses how to work towards individuality while disregarding others' opinions, showing the difference between making a commitment and talking one out, and how to remain focused while still achieving great accomplishments.","
The quest for individuality is a key part of finding our own path in life. To remain true to our convictions and steer away from the opinions of others, it is necessary to make a commitment to ourselves and our beliefs. This commitment should not be talked away, because when we go back on our word, we are only fooling ourselves. True accomplishments are achieved when focus is steadfast and we are mindful of the purpose behind our aims. To remain focused, it is important to take regular breaks and measure our progress against our goals. When any extraneous noise arises, be it from external or internal sources, it is important to resist becoming distracted and to stay accountable to our self-determined targets. In this way, we can achieve great accomplishments and avoid succumbing to the opinions of those around us."
6531927DF837,"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how it's used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when we've missed an important assignment or other things.

The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of it's dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school.

Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however you'd like. This is where a teenager's habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We don't have the right to control how people use their phone and that's where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone.

Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just don't suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phone's are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices.

I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our student's with how they're approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.","
Task: Research how the use of cell phones in the classroom affects academic performance and engagement. Investigate whether there is a correlation between the amount of screen time and educational success, and explore potential solutions to make the use of cell phones in the classroom more effective.","
Recent studies have shown that the use of cell phones in the classroom can have a negative effect on academic performance and student engagement. Data has shown that students who spend more time on their cell phones in the classroom tend to have lower grades and decreased engagement in class activities. In order to make the use of cell phones more effective in the classroom, it is recommended that schools set clear boundaries and rules to limit the amount of time students spend on their cell phones during class time. Other potential solutions include providing students with learning apps and programs to use on their cell phones that are related to the subject they are learning in class, as well as giving students more incentive to stay off their phones and focus on their studies."
653620381DB3,"Do you think that high schoool should only be 3 years instead of 4 years. well some might say it would be better having 3 year's of school other then 4 year's. but the way to achieve it is difficult.

I think that school should be only 3 years. beacause some student don't really want to be in school for too long. this can give student's a goal so that they don't have to stay for 4 years. it would give the students a higher chance to focus in school and then head out to college for those who are interested.

I belive that if student's can find a goal of having to be going for 3 years in school instead of 4 year's. it would take them hard work and confident in order to earn it but other's might say that they perfer to be in school longer. because of friend's or liking to learn alot and it no rush toward them for they are interted in learning.

Task: 
Research the impact of changing public high school duration from four years to three years. Analyze advantages and disadvantages of this change for students. Identify other factors that could have a significant role in the decision to pursue three years of high school. Develop a conclusion based on your research.","
After researching the potential impact of shortening the duration of public high school from four years to three, it is clear that there could be both advantages and disadvantages of such a change. On the positive side, a three-year program could give students the opportunity to enter college or the workforce one year earlier than those in a four-year program, allowing them to fast-track their educational or career pursuits. However, it could also alienate those who would have otherwise benefitted from an additional year of high school, such as those looking to improve their academic scores or those needing an extra year to acclimate to the pre-university or employment environment.

Ultimately, the decision to pursue three years of high school should take into account several other factors. These could include students’ academic readiness levels, the availability of extracurriculars and support services, and the larger socio-economic environment that will affect a student’s educational and career prospects. Based on these considerations, it is clear that every individual must evaluate the risks and benefits of a three-year high school program against their own personal circumstances, and the potential impact of the decision on their future success."

65593BCE26BF,"Many schools have partnerships with local companies. It allow students to explore certain professions. Students needs a lot of stuff to success in life. Schools should have the qualities to help their students success.

Schools should have a partnership business to help all the students to reach their goals. Helping the students to improve their skills and give them time to improve their brains as well. Having a partnership is much easier, because members helps when its needed.

Partnership is easier, because if the business doesn't work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. Taking the risk alone is very hard, It's as hard as touching the clouds. Having all the risk alone is horrible, for an example it can causes living in the street or losing all the money that the person have. I want to live a good life when I grow up , so I won't like to take all the risk by myself. I don't want to lose all my money so I would be happy to have a partnership member to help me out. Plus Not working alone, I do not like to work alone in life. I would love to work with other people when I grow up.

Sharing Is one thing I like about partnership. It's not only sharing the risks, but sharing the good stuff too. Sharing ideas to make the profit better. Sharing money to grow the business. Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness.

Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and it's the most important thing in a partnership business.

A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing. It will help students to improve their skills. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and

5. Examine the ways in which schools can help students be successful. 
6. Write an essay on the implications of schools having a partnership with a local company.","
When it comes to schools having local partnerships, there are various risks and rewards involved. On one hand, schools can benefit from the expertise and resources that companies bring to the table. They can also provide students with a better understanding of the industry and potential career paths they can explore. On the other hand, this collaboration requires communication, trust, and a lot of effort to ensure that both parties come away with a positive outcome. 

Challenges that come with forming partnerships can range from not understanding the company's values and goals, to different levels of commitment between schools and businesses. On the other hand, benefits of collaboration can include access to mentors and resources, project-based learning opportunities, and more diverse classroom learning experiences. 

Successful businesses with local partnerships often create positive, lasting changes within their communities. For example, schools with strong business partnerships may have access to new technologies, mentors, and community resources. This can help students stay engaged in their studies and equip them with the skills they need to succeed. Additionally, these partnerships can open doors for students, offering internships and job prospects, while helping the community grow in the process. 

Through careful consideration and thoughtful partnerships, schools have the potential to become a much needed source of hope and opportunity for students. The risks and rewards of having a partnership with a local company should be carefully weighed out in order to maximize the benefits for students. By exploring these implications and establishing strategies that help students succeed, schools can create an environment that helps young adults to reach their highest potential."
655BD307F87D,"Many students in high school are looking for the way to reduce their time in school, there are several reason for students to think about it. These students might be passing through hard situatons, such as: economical crisis, issues at home, need of independence or any other problems that is not allowing them to be in school the time they should be in, but some people do not need a short period in high school because of they are struggling, this group of people might want go to college earlier or get a job as soon as possible for personal reason.

In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country. In fact many of this people is looking a better life here, the life they could not have in their countries because of their governments, scarcity of resources, scarcity of jobs, low wages, dangerous areas and many others situations that nobody would like to live. Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school.

In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation.

Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money.

The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general.

For students, the exertion of taking multiple classes can often be mentally and physically draining, making it difficult to stay motivated and engaged.

In the United States, there are multiple national programs that offer students the opportunity to reduce their time spent in high school. The Department of Education has implemented initiatives like the Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Program to allow students the chance to obtain high school credits at a faster pace. Additionally, many states have implemented dual enrollment programs for high school students to take college classes with the potential for credit. 

The advantages of programs such as these are multifold. These initiatives provide students the opportunity to take classes in high school that they would otherwise not have the chance to experience. They also allow students the capacity to further develop their interest in particular subjects, by allowing them to have a more expansive learning experience. Finally, programs such as these may reduce the cost of attending college by reducing the amount of course credits needed for graduation.

6586DF43A92D,"I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying.

Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.

Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim. A failure is what makes us strong and successful we just have to give that failure enthusiasim to keep trying and to succeed.","

65975436BE5C,"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.","

Self-esteem is the foundation for feelings of self-worth and courage, and can be cultivated from positive affirmations provided by others. Studies have shown that we are more likely to reach goals and feel secure when we receive positive affirmations from those around us. Trust in oneself and others can also help to build self-esteem, bolstering confidence and resilience. 

To illustrate, an individual who may have previously felt lack of faith in their ability to complete a task, may receive praise from an adult for their progress thus far. This well-intentioned encouragement can be a large motivator for the individual, as it helps make them feel capable and affirmed in their mission. It also shows that there are people around who believe in them and trust their potential.

65B1F548E8BE,"As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home.

Students would not be able to socialize with other students. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I personnel can't stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them.

Students would not be responsible in the future. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.

While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldn't be able to do any activies in school.

Students shouldn't be allow to take classes at home while other student's go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldn't be able to enjoy the life of a teenager. As a result, Do you think it will help student's in the future?","
Task: Research the pros and cons of students attending classes from home. Consider the effects it can have on socialization, responsibility, and experience. Provide an opinion on the effects of distance learning on students in the future.","
Recent studies on the effects of distance learning on students' learning outcomes have shown both pros and cons. On one hand, students who attend classes from home are able to learn in an environment that is tailored to their own individual learning styles. This can provide a more engaging learning experience compared to traditional classrooms, as students are in charge of their own learning pace and environment. 

However, students attending classes from home can suffer from issues concerning socialization, responsibility, and experience. Without face-to-face communication, many important learning and life skills such as team work, public speaking, and interpersonal communication are lost. Also, there is comparatively a lack of responsibility and guidance for progress when in an online setting.

Overall, the future of distance learning for students remains, at the very least, uncertain. For those who struggle to learn in a traditional setting, distance learning can provide a great alternative. Equally, traditional classrooms are still preferred by some for a number of reasons, such as social connection and assessment feedback. It is important that students are given the option to choose between the two learning methods in order to create an ideal learning environment."

Task: 

Research the role of education in improving individual and global economic and social outcomes. Consider the different ways that individuals can access higher education, and the potential impacts of different techniques. Investigate examples of educational efforts that have been successful in promoting economic development or reducing poverty. Examine the ways that students can raise the financial resources to attend college and what policies could be implemented to make higher education more accessible.  Analyze the potential for people to use education to build businesses and increase","
Education has a profound impact on both individual economic and social outcomes and global economic and social conditions. Education can provide individuals with opportunities to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the workforce, thereby improving their individual economic prospects. It can also empower people to have a greater voice in their communities and participate more fully in their societies. Additionally, education can have a positive impact on global economic and social outcomes by creating a more educated and productive workforce.

When it comes to accessing higher education, there are a number of different approaches. Governments can offer student loans, scholarships, and grants to make higher education more accessible. Private companies, nonprofits, and other organizations can also step in to provide financing for students or establish scholarships for underserved communities. Additionally, students can use crowdfunding to raise money for their educations, or take on part-time or full-time jobs to cover tuition costs.

There are many examples of educational efforts that have been successful in promoting economic development or reducing poverty. For instance, in India, the government launched a program to provide free laptops and internet access to economically disadvantaged students, which has resulted in a reduction in poverty in the region. In Tanzania, a program to train teachers in the use of technology has enabled students to access online courses and educational resources that otherwise would not have been available.

In order to make higher education more accessible, governments and other organizations need to create policies and programs that focus on reducing the financial barriers that prevent individuals from attending college. This could include providing more financial aid, expanding student loan and grant programs, and providing tax credits to those who pay tuition. Additionally, more needs to be done to fund and support initiatives that help students access the resources they need to complete their education. 

Finally, education can be used as a tool to create economic opportunities for people. Individuals can use their education to start businesses and develop products that will benefit their communities and economies. Education can also help to increase the productivity of businesses, as workers can use their skills and knowledge to increase efficiency and lower costs. In this way, education can be a powerful tool for reducing poverty and promoting economic development."
65CC82C9B3C9,"I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.

Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.

People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.

In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.","
    Task: Write an essay on the benefits of taking a four-day weekend for people's mental and physical health. Discuss how this could be beneficial for schools and the environment, as well as employers and employees.","
Taking a four-day weekend can have a positive impact on both mental and physical health. Researchers have found that taking a break, even for a few days, can help to refuel and refresh the mind and body. For one, having an extended weekend can help to reduce stress levels from the daily pressures of work and life. This can help to restore a feeling of calm and balance which can be beneficial for physical health. Moreover, having the extra day can allow us to engage in activities we don’t otherwise have time for such as socializing with family and friends, taking the time to relax, or doing something for self-care. 

Furthermore, having a four-day weekend can have many benefits for schools, the environment, employers, and employees. For schools, it could grant students an additional day to get organized, study, or attend tutoring. Additionally, it could provide a unique opportunity for field trips or use the day for special programming. For the environment, having an extra day off could reduce fossil fuel emissions and lead to a cleaner environment. Employers and employees could also benefit from having the extra day to rest and recoup. Additionally, employers might be able to save on operational costs if the business is closed for the additional day. 

In conclusion, taking a four-day weekend can be beneficial for overall mental and physical health, schools, the environment, employers, and employees. "
65DBDD75CA50,"Jonh once said, Technology had positive and negative effects on people's life, people complete many tasks without having contact with others. Some people said that technology is good because they can do many thinks, like find books, information and do works more easy. Other people thinks differents, they said that technology is bad because had negative effects on people life, if people do not know how to use it, they can will have problems because sometimes people send archivements or informations to the wrong person or publish it. I think that technology is bad because with technology we can do many thinks, but some people use technology for hacks, steal acounts and cheat persons.

First, some people said that the technology is important in this era, because is more easy to do many thinks,

for example, search specific information more fast.

To do homeworks or company works with more information and explanations make projects, glide planes or to find books and work without think a lot.

Second,the technology is very important to some people, because many times they used it to do they works and make some project, the technology in this era provoked many wrong thinks, it created many electronic thinks that are advanced. Then, the purpose of use technology if for good reasons and with the technology always people will have easy infornation but they wil not learn the technology caused that people lose their time playing videos games and visiting wrongs wed site. However, the technology caused many problems, the people are using the electronic thinks a lot, the cellphone, video games etc. It are creating a obsession in the people, many kids and adolocents have problems with they vision, because pass a lot of time in the cell phone, computer or playing videos games causing cancer, tumor or lose their vision.

Finally, the obsession that technology are creating is very worrying, many kids don't do the homeworks, the students text in class and do not put attention, other persons driving texting causing accidents. Some parents permit that they kids use technology, but they do not have the contol of them the adolecents use technology for have fun sometimes causing problems. Today in this era the technology are advancing and provoking that people do not learn and sometimes it cause the death, persons use technology sometimes to hacks acounts and steal informations, photos or they publish inappropriate photos in they acounts causing bullyng or making the person feels bad. Also, the technology is very advance that the people are creating robot to make more easy the works, but is is a ploblem because the robot will be remove the people jobs, causing that the people leaving whithout job.

In conclusion, the technology had negative effects on people's life, creating obsession on people and doing more easy the ability to do works,but for people tha use technology a lot need to have a limit, and if they have acounts with important information they need to protect it with a strong password, if they have kids and permit that use technology they need to control them what they do and put a limit how much can use the computer, cell phone or videos games. people have to put their own limit to control technology when it cause problems.","
Task: Research the effects of technology on people's lives. Investigate positive and negative aspects of technology, and how it can influence people's health, personal relationships, and professional success. Analyze how people can use technology responsibly and limit its negative impacts.","
Technology has become an integral part of our lives, both in the workplace and in our personal lives. While the advances made possible by technology have been beneficial for many, they have also made it easier for us to become over-reliant on digital resources and lose our natural connection with people and our environment.

One of the biggest dangers of technology is its potential to negatively affect our physical and mental health. Prolonged exposure to blue light emitted by electronic devices can disrupt our natural circadian rhythms, causing a range of issues including insomnia, fatigue, and mood disturbances. Additionally, too much time spent on devices is linked to an increase in feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Technology can also impact our personal relationships. The prevalence of social media sites and messaging apps has given our phone screens priority over in-person interactions, preventing us from developing deeper connections with those closest to us.

Fortunately, technology does have the potential to be used responsibly. Limiting our exposure to blue light by avoiding screens at night, and keeping dedicated tech-free time is one way to ensure technology has limited negative impacts. Additionally, setting boundaries for yourself with regard to social media use can help foster healthier relationships. By recognizing the potential risks of technology and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure technology continues to be an asset to our lives."
66133AC6189A,"On my experiences I think It would be impossible to change the first impressions becuase one different people have different types of characteristics traits. For example one of my friend who move to text,her characteristic traits I remember she was so nice to everybody when she use to live her in virginia and also she use to get along with everbody at the school. This shows that type of impressions that my friend Generic_Name has.

Another example is when I was in lunch line with my friend Generic_Name,a spanish girl touch my hair,I did not know that girl was the girlfriend of the boy that was in one of my class. Until then when I was going to my third class I ask that boy if he could help me find this class because I did not know where all my classes were,when he came up to me to explain the schuedule and told me and him had the same class,his girlfriend look at me mad. This shows that at first the girl of the boy was nice and then the girl of the boy was kind of mean to mean.

Last example everbody has different types of impressions,it could be in a good way or bad way. Sometimes people impressions might change or they might still be the same.","
Task: Research and decide if first impressions are difficult to change and provide examples.","
First impressions, the initial evaluation of another person or situation, are frequently believed to be highly influential and resistant to change. Many studies have found that people are heavily biased toward initial impressions; once formed, they are difficult to alter.  For example, in the business world, an individual's first impression is often used as the basis for long-term judgements about their personality and capabilities. Also, research has consistently shown that hiring decisions are strongly influenced by first impressions – a candidate's interview appearance, mannerisms, and written resume usually play a major role in the ultimate xdecision. Overall, it is clear that first impressions often make a lasting impact, and can be difficult to undo."
66241AEC8351,"Changing our school meun to much healthier choice's is a good idea because its good for the students to eat much healthier food in school. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired and you won't have theenergy to do anything. Its better to take away the opition of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students wont be so tempted to eat it, and could chose a better and healthier choice.

Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. adding more healthier choices in th school caferteria meun could help them stay in shape. most students don't workout so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out becuase of how the food is made. The school could make a slald bar for those who chose to eat it and they could add there own toppings so they could eat somthing they like instead of throwing it out.

I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and its healthy for students to eat and enjoy. most students wont have to get uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.

in conclusion changing the schools cafeterias meun to much healthier choice would be good for students and staff members so they could stay healthy and focus.","
Task: Research the benefits of eating healthier foods in school compared to junk food, identify the most popular healthier snacks amongst students, and create a plan that outlines steps to implement healthier food options into school cafeterias.","
Research has shown that there are numerous benefits to providing healthier food options in school cafeterias. Studies have found that students who eat healthier, balanced meals during the school day perform better in class, have higher cognitive functioning, and feel more energized and ready to learn. Furthermore, introducing healthier snacks such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and alternative grains can help counteract the effects of processed and sugary snacks that are popular amongst students. 

To effectively implement healthier food options in school cafeterias, the following steps should be taken: 

1. Conduct an audit of the current food items offered in the school lunchroom. 
2. Survey the students to learn their preferences for healthy snacks. 
3. Introduce nutritious whole foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, seeds, and nuts, as well as plant-based substitutes to traditional lunch items. 
4. Educate the students on the importance of making healthier food choices. 
5. Set aside time for students to participate in activities that promote healthy eating habits. 
6. Establish a partnership with local farmers and food vendors to provide fresh, wholesome food items for the school lunchroom. 
7. Monitor the implementation, adjusting the plan as needed."
66288718AF60,"When you need advice do you just talk to one person or more? Its way better telling people the things that happen so you can get there view because you might not see it the way they do. When you tell more people you get more advice and thats good. Let's say that you have some things going on in your life and you want some advice to try to make it a bit better so you ask a couple of your friends to help you and give you some advice. They give you advice and you take it and try it and it works so it made you feel it better but thats only one advice they gave from all your friends so there is still a bit more. So you day got better. An yes i understand sometimes you don't want to share your stuff with people so you just have one friend you tell everything to and they help with everything they listen,give back what they think. An yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one perosn is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and i get that but when you need advice do you just want that person or alot of people giving you advice. It's your choice on what pick.

But i still asking people for some advice is better because like i said earlier they give more advice, They will give there option and tell if if your in the right or wrong. An they will always be there for you no matter what, thats why i say yes. because you never know what they will tell you or do about the things you tell them but if there real friends they'll stick by yotu side no matter what.","
Task: Analyze the pros and cons of seeking advice from one versus multiple people when making important life decisions.","
Seeking advice from one person when making important life decisions can be an effective approach when that person possesses expertise in the area. Having one opinion can also help to keep the decision-making process more organized and straightforward. On the other hand, consulting only one person for an important decision may limit the breadth of perspectives on the issue and may ignore information gaps that multiple perspectives could fill. Additionally, relying on the opinion of one person could increase the risk of bias when such a person has a personal interest in the decision being made. 

Getting advice from multiple people when making an important life decision can provide valuable insight into the issue and may help to capture a variety of perspectives. Additionally, this approach may reduce the risk of bias due to the larger source pool of advice. The downside of using multiple people as sources of advice is that it can be difficult to manage an opinion from a large group and can be less efficient than relying on the counsel of a single source."
6642E181B08D,"I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else.

no body would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework.

In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people)

they also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it.

Plus many students really love summer because the weather( the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedoom not worry about your grades, activities, projects and etc. makes a lot of diference between a long break and a shorter brake, but I also take the position of the educator, I know they wouldnt like to been repeating things to make student remenber of the subjects they saw the last year and having issues with things they forgot, That would be really stressful but come on! Who wouldnt like a big vacation? good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer.

I also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but theres another big example of why vacation should be longer. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do )

to can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue.

and probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter.

In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.","
Task: 

1. Research the amount of break time during the school year that students typically receive compared to non-student adults.
2. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in spring and fall.
3. Analyze reasons why students may plan goals during the summer, such as getting a full-time job or saving money for college.
4. Evaluate the impact of having","
According to research, students typically receive far more break time throughout the school year than non-student adults. A 3-4 week break in the summer offers students time to relax and recharge, but it can also put them behind in their academic studies when school re-starts. Similarly, a longer winter break may give students more time to prepare for upcoming exams, but some may neglect their studies over the holidays. Spring and fall breaks provide a nice balance between the short summer break and the longer winter break, giving students a week to rest and reset midway through the academic year. 

Students who use the summer break to their advantage can set goals such as gaining professional experience by securing a full-time job or saving money for college. This helps them to prepare for the future, as well as establish a sense of responsibility and independence. This can in turn have a significant impact on their long-term success and the skills they gain over summer breaks can help to make them even more attractive to future employers."
6686DB25FBD0,"I believe that gaining life experience and learning from your mistakes and working hard, comes when we are always doing something and accomplish more. Accomplish more and always doing something is important to me because it gives me more opportunity to be successful in life .

To begin with,by practicing playing my favorite sport ,soccer everyday after school and on my free time; because I was in my school team and I was really bad and weak at it .Practicing helped me to overcome my weakness and to learn from my mistakes ,and also to know the rules of the game and basis of soccer.

Some people believe inactivity serve a purpose that led you to success;however, we gain life experience and learning from our mistakes if we are always doing something or we accomplished more . Also,by practicing soccer everyday and working hard on it,I learned tricks and how to kick the ball directly to my teammates and how to be good goal keeper and catch the ball as well. And that gives me more experience and strength to continue.

Another example,one day we were playing and their was judgments there,choosing the best player to be in the ""International Soccer Team"" ,depending on how the player plays and how they follow the rules. Three days later, I got nominated to participate in the International team and I also got honored for being the best player in the game and of course, that led me to successful opportunity in the future.

In conclusion, by working hard and always doing something makes, you to gain life experience and more opportunities and to accomplish more. To accomplish something is not easy, you have to face a lot of difficulties and facing those difficulties and get over it that's what meant by accomplish .It will walk you through a lot to accomplish something in your life, you just have to keep going and to work hard and never give up and all of that will pays off by being success in your life .","

66C2FA45A48B,"Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one.

The government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process.

The prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust.

Parents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more.

Having a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned.

One of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day.

In conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.","

Proponents of this idea argue that it could provide students with more breaks and lighter homework loads, as well as giving them more time to explore and pursue activities beyond the classroom. On the other hand, opponents of this concept worry that it could cause kids to experience fatigue and lack of focus due to the length of each day.

In terms of advantages, there is the potential for improved student productivity due to the shorter but longer school days. This could encourage them to better manage their time, become more organized, and complete tasks more efficiently. Furthermore, the extended weekend could allow for good recreational activities and potentially more time spent with family.

On the flipside, the downside to a four-day, ten-hour school week may be that students will be required to attend school for a much longer period of time each day than usual. This could lead to feelings of exhaustion and could be particularly difficult for younger students who are already more susceptible to tiredness. Additionally, it could cause them to lose valuable time with friends and affect their social development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt or reject a four-day, ten-hour school schedule should only be made after careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks. It is important for administrators to keep in mind that an effective school day should provide students with a balance of academic and extracurricular activities, and should ensure that their physical and mental health are both taken into account."
66F03584BCA5,"Should people make their own decision, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters ? Some people value self reliance and feel the need to follow their own instincts and ideas. Although these people are confident and trust themselves,I believe people should ask for advice from their parents and other professionals before making important life decisions.

First of all, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents. They help me look at both the good and bad things about different job. They bring up things that I may have not thought about. Their advice help me make better decisions. I appreciate their knowledge because they know me very well and want the best for me. Therefor, I thing It' is important to ask for their guidance in these matters.

Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education. For instance, after I graduate from high school and earn my diploma I will ask my teacher about the possibility of going to a community college or taking extra classes to help me get a good job that will make me happy and provide me with skills make so that I can live a better life. My teacher have worked hard with me to provide me with guidance and the skills I need to be smart in life.

Thatswhy,

I think people should ask for help and guidance from their parents and teacher before making important life decisions. Both my parents and my teachers know my strengths and weaknesses and can help me in making the best decisions.","

Talk to teachers and get their opinion on continuing education, such as attending a community college or taking extra classes. Consider their guidance carefully before making a decision.","
I've been researching different job options and discussing them with my parents to consider the pros and cons of each. My teachers have been an invaluable resource in this process, sharing their perspective on continuing my education by attending a community college or taking extra classes. They've emphasized the importance of considering their guidance carefully before making a decision. Although this process of research and deliberation can be daunting, I'm confident that I'm on the right track."
66F7AD6B99E2,"I should agree because it can make your grades higher by joining sports, after school subjects or classes, and it make you more smarter and more. In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesn't want to participate because they're lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up.

I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didn't followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies.

If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities.

And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesn't want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

The best thing is for the students who want to try or join the team for basketball, tennis, badminton, baseball, hockey, and wrestling is the best thing because few students always wants to join or try for the team. And my two friends join for basketball and hockey my one friend named Generic_Name wants to try out for baseball this spring season and he is really good at basketball and baseball, but the only wrong for him is he has bad grades. I know that students should have good grades before you try out for the team. Generic_Name made a decision to stay after class and do the retakes and after 3 weeks Generic_Name has good grades and he try out for baseball and made the team.\

I agree that students should participate to after school classes or sports. Even me I stayed after school just to finish my work or do some retakes and get a better grade this year. Before I also don't want to go to after school classes, but when I got a really bad grades I started to go to a after school classes and finish work and do retakes and here I got some good grades.","

John is a student in my class who is having trouble understanding our course material. I believe it would be helpful for John to attend after school classes or join sports to help him increase his understanding of the material and improve his grades.

First, I plan to meet with John one-on-one and explain why these activities would be beneficial. I will explain how the after school classes and sports will provide an opportunity for him to learn in more depth and ask questions. I will also discuss how the increased physical activity could help him stay motivated and focused in class. Lastly, I'll tell John about another student in our class who was struggling academically and attended after school classes which led to an improvement in the student's grades.

After this conversation, it is my hope that John will be encouraged to enroll in these activities. With this plan, I am confident that John will have the tools to succeed in the classroom."
66F8D7FB98BE,"I think that several people make there own decision's then other people about there life because"" they might need help on what to do?""for the people that need guidance to know more info.

I belive that the the people that found a way of making there own decision were so confidence that they had to decided on what to do. but if they don't, it would be wise to ask for assistance to make decision with experts so that way they can have in idea of what decison to make. because if they had made there own decision that they had regret that would have been there issue for not making a wise chose. but anyway people who are confidence can make there own choices.

other however the ones that need assistent might not know what to do when they have a decision to make. those people ask for help. they ask for guidance so that they can have more of an idea of what they are going to decide which gives them a more higher opportunity to decide which could led up to a good or bad situation. it all depend's on the person who is determen to decide.

i suggest that both ways all depend on a person because we all have our difffent way's and many can cause a huge impact on people life the more info you know the better you have to understand what path you are taking because new's had spred that people are making wrong decision which led to to be indanger.

some say that making your own decision is your issue while some ask for assistent to know what to do in a situation. which can be good for several people around the world.","
Task:
Explore the pros and cons of making your own decisions versus getting help in making decisions, and analyze the potential impact these decisions can have. Consider different perspectives and use real-world examples where available.","
Decision making can be a challenging process. On one hand, making your own decisions and being independent can be empowering. You may find that taking ownership of things and making your own decisions grants you better control and autonomy. You also may develop the skills to make sound judgments and navigate through difficulties. On the other hand, deciding on your own can present some risks. It’s possible to make decisions without all the necessary information or resources. Furthermore, it can be hard to remain impartial when making decisions without guidance and feedback from a trusted source. When it comes to making major decisions, taking advice from an experienced professional or loved one can help you weigh the potential positive and negative impacts. Through consulting with those outside your own perspective, you can gain insights that you wouldn’t have come to on your own. One example of this is when an individual faces a difficult situation, such as where to go to college, a career move, or investment decision. Seeking advice from family or advisers, can help the individual gain clarity and make an educated assessment of the situation. No matter how you choose to approach your decision making, it’s important to remember that the choices you make have the potential to cause ripples in your life. Therefore, it’s important to be mindful of who and what you surround yourself with."
66FF0907BF26,"Do you ever wonder if most students use their phones in school for educational purposes? In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music. When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then don't know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board.

Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. When listening to music when you're working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages.

Most teachers don't allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyone's going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school it'll be easier for them to call you.

Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldn't have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldn't be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and that's why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.","
Task: Research the positive and negative impacts of cell phone use in the classroom, and compare/contrast the results.","
Cell phones have become integral elements of modern life, so it is no surprise that their use in the classroom has been receiving much attention. Many schools and universities have varying policies surrounding the use of cell phones in learning environments, ranging from complete bans to learning scenarios that include cell phone use. Arguments for and against the use of cell phones in the classroom can be found on both sides of the discussion. 

Positively, cell phones can offer many benefits to the learning process, enabling students to access information quickly and easily. Additionally, text messaging, email, and other online communication tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between students and teachers. Smart phones are also able to capture photos and videos that students can use for research projects.

On the other hand, cell phone use in the classroom has shown to be distracting to both students and teachers. Cellphones can be used to cheat on tests, watch videos, or send messages if not monitored properly. Additionally, too much reliance on cell phones can lead to students not learning the material in-depth. 

Overall, the effects of cell phone use in the classroom will depend heavily on the policies and administration monitoring their use. The benefits of technology must be balanced with the possible negative impacts to ensure a safe and productive learning environment. "
6712BD512DB7,"I agreed that the greater of us lies and not in setting our aim high or low, but setting our aim too low will achieve our mark because many people around us are down and falling for some reasons. But, they are trying their best to climb up to the top in order to achieve their goals and learning from their mistakes. However, many others are lying or cheating to get a better score and failing down slowly. In fact, many people are working-hard to accomplish the goal that they want to achieve.

Setting our aim too low will achieve our goals because people have a weakness in their job and that's the reason why that they should be trying their best to fix their mistakes. I used to failed my math class last year because I didn't understand the unit because it's was too hard for me. So, I started to stay after school with my teacher and asking questions because I want to make sure that I understand the lesson. However, that didn't work out a lot as I expected because the assignment was different from what my teacher was explaining to me. But, I did not give up yet so I decided to study more at home and do some research about the lesson. And I finally understood the lesson. No matter how hard the work is, but what's important is that I put my time and efforts on it.

Another reason why setting our aim too low will help us achieve the goal is that by trying your best and work hard for it in order to achieve. However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. My best friend got a high score on the test because he cheated and the test was hard as well. The teacher was wondered how did he got a high school on the test because he was the only one who got the highest score in the class, then he lied to my teacher that he studied a lot last night. But, the teacher caught him cheated on the test by using the notes because his answers was exactly as the notes said. So, it's not a shame that you are failing at something; but, it's a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down.

Also, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want. During the summer break, I told my mom that I want a new computer because my old computer is glitching and broken down a lot. Then, she told me that I work to earn money and get the new computer. She also said that it will helps me learn more things about the world. So, I started to work at a small restaurant and my position was cashier. It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people.

Many people disagreed that setting our aim low won't help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy. However, once the people find out that you're lying to them then you know the consequences. Sometime people starting at the lowest score to the highest score because they are doing their best of abilities to get the what they wanted to.

In conclusion, starting at the lowest point to the highest point will help you figure out what you need to do or learn in order to reach the goal. For example, if you don't try your best to achieve your goal and it's the worst thing that you could've ever done. However, the other are spreading lies to people how they achieve their goal easily and convincing people to be like them. But, keep trying your best and never give up to achieve your goal; then, you can get what you want.","
Task: Write an essay about the importance of setting goals and working hard to achieve them. Consider examples of how lying or cheating to reach your aims can have a negative outcome.","
Setting goals and working hard to achieve them is one of the most effective strategies for success. Goals allow us to focus on specific areas of our lives we wish to improve and provide us with a roadmap for reaching those goals. By setting realistic goals and taking steps to reach them, we can move closer to our important pursuits.

Unfortunately, there are those who utilize deceit or unethical behavior to reach their aims. Lying and cheating can be very tempting, but the repercussions are often much greater than the short-term benefits. Many often forget that breaking the rules and pursuing their goals dishonestly can lead to serious consequences that include severe financial penalties, loss of reputation, and even incarceration.

In the end, it's important to remember that setting goals and working hard to achieve them is the most productive and reliable way to succeed. Despite the temptations of lying and cheating to reach our objectives, the long-term ramifications can be too costly for most people. A better strategy is to use our skills, time, and resources to create a plan that will sustain our success over the long term."

this a good council because if the city do curfew all teenager can be safe and they can have resposabilidad with dont breaking the law, with a curfew the city can try to keep safe all citizen and the young people can keep out of troubles.

Task: Research the effects that curfews have on teenagers and their communities, and discuss the pros and cons of imposing curfews in cities.","
Recent studies have shown that the imposition of curfews can have both positive and negative effects on teenagers and their communities. On the positive side, curfews can lead to improved safety levels, as they restrict the number of hours that teens can be out and potentially engaging in risky activities. Additionally, curfews can lead to improved morale within the community, as they can reduce levels of vandalism and youth delinquency. On the negative side, curfews can be disproportionately enforced, and teens who abide by the rule may unfairly be suspected of criminal activity when out after curfew hours. Furthermore, teens may express feelings of resentment or entrapment when curfews are imposed, which can lead to an erosion of general trust within a community. Ultimately, when considering the impact of curfews on teenagers and their communities, it is important to consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy."
6751442A85E4,"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someone's help. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life.

Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. It can help you in many ways. For example, when you're angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. That's the time to express your feeling to someone else. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you don't want to end up one day behind bars.

Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. Meaning that, it's most likely for you to have a positive mind. I remember when I decided to break my friend's trophies. I was so mad that I wasn't thinking right. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasn't right. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. Sometimes it's better to make the right choices because it releases our stress.

Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but it's the complete opposite. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life.

Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision.                                 ","
Task: Write an essay discussing why people should seek guidance when making decisions and how it can help them be more successful in life.","

Some people thinking what the failure is important for they life because they learning a new things and they put all of they for doing good person. Clarity, this people due everything for not failure something.

Failure often has a negative connotation attached to it, but this statement speaks to the importance of failure in one’s journey to success. Success is not an end-goal that can be achieved in one stroke of genius, but rather an ongoing adventure punctuated by failures that help shape our progress. Failure can teach us valuable lessons about ourselves and our experiences, and serves to refine our methods and approaches to better facilitate our success. Understanding this makes failure less daunting and more a necessary part of the equation to success. 

It is also critical to have an enthusiastic mindset towards failure, for it allows us to reflect and analyze our mistakes without letting them bog us down. More often than not, our failures point us in the direction of success and provide us with the knowledge and experience we need to finish the journey. For without failure, we would remain in a state of comfortable mediocrity, never pushing ourselves beyond our limits to see our true potential. 

In conclusion, “success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm” is a powerful statement that powerfully encapsulates the role of failure in the progress towards success. With an optimistic outlook towards failure, we can use it to our advantage and find our true path to success."
67D58F9FA53C,"I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other

.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. Okay this off the topic that we are talking about okay, all most every billoner drop of of school and collage to start what they wanted to do and what there dream was the did not stop it they all went for it

Okay now this is back on the topic. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .

Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.","

The principal's view that all students should be involved in a sport, club, or after school activity is an interesting one that warrants serious consideration. On the one hand, there is much to be said for the benefits of student participation in activities of this kind. Students can learn teamwork and social skills, have the opportunity to exercise, learn additional skills and compete against one another, and become active members of their school’s community. On the other hand, it is important to consider that this view is not suitable for all students. For some, the commitment and pressures of regular activity may be too great, or they may already be involved in activities outside of school that already fill their schedules. A sensible approach is necessary in which all students are encouraged to participate in as many activities as possible, but no one is left feeling overwhelmed. Ultimately, the principal’s view is one worth considering, taking into account a balance between pressure and fun."

67DD73D48474,"83% of people say that the idea of extending the school day by two hours is a bad plan, For those who dont know the average school day is abut 8:00 am -2:45 pm. The time that students get out of school should not change because the changing of the time would case cognitive impairment and students not having inf time for their jobs after school.

The idea of extending the school day would case cognitive impairment, For example, When my friend got sleepy for doing a school project late last Kite he would constantly forget he had homework and always feel uninterested in doing stuff, When I got tired I have forgotten to check the time that I had to get to work.

The plan would case students not having inf time for their jobs after school. For instance, When I had to stay after school for a test I had to miss work, and my manager had to cut my pay for messing work, Because i had to stay after school I lost my chains to get paid for my hard work.

Some people say that the plane would give students a four-day week than are five-day week. However it still dose not address that facts that people well not retain much memory of what they lend do to long school hour, and not having inf time of finding a job. It would be best to not to change are present schools start times and end times.","
Task: 

Analyze the potential risks and benefits of extending the school day by two hours. Examine how cognitive impairment, availability of after-school work, and having a four-day week impacts students’ ability to learn and succeed. Assess whether the current school day should or should not be changed.","
Extending the school day by two hours could have both beneficial and detrimental effects on students. On the one hand, a longer school day could provide more time for learning, but on the other hand, it could lead to increased fatigue and cognitive impairment in students. Furthermore, many students currently have after-school jobs, so two additional hours could limit their availability and slow their progress. Additionally, implementing a four-day week could reduce the availability of time to socialize and have free time. Ultimately, while it is intended to increase students’ educational success, the potential downsides might outweigh the benefits when considering the diverse needs of all students. For these reasons, the current school day should not be extended."
67E711AF87A2,"Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. In the process of trying to master things in life it will be important for professionalism,money,and being successful.

Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at.

Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future.

Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me.

When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. The more you grow the more better you'll get.

When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes. Some may say if you don't go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything.

Always try to do more then what you have already done. Dont let anyone stop you. You will not grow if you don't go beyond from where you are at. It's good to do anything it takes to master something in life. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow.                                                      ","
Task: Research how important professionalism, effort, and dedication are in succeeding in life. Analyze the stories of Cristiano Ronaldo and yourself to compare. Find other examples and relate them to the importance of mastering skills in life. Evaluate the role of money and success in achieving goals.","
When researching how important professionalism, effort, and dedication are in succeeding in life, one need look no further than the inspiring story of Cristiano Ronaldo. His perseverance and dedication to mastering his skills has earned him the opportunity to become one of the best professional soccer players of this era. Just as Ronaldo worked hard to find success, many people around the world have found their own success by honing their skills and dedicating themselves to mastering their craft. 

However, money and success do play a role in achieving goals. Ronaldo's success was partially due to his endorsement deals and his access to proper training. It is worth noting that not everyone has access to the same amount of resources, and thus a “level playing field” does not always exist. In addition, some people may become distracted by the pursuit of money and success, and not focus on honing the skills that will truly bring them success. 

To conclude, it is clear that professionalism, effort and dedication are essential to succeeding in life. The story of Cristiano Ronaldo is a testament to this, and can serve as an inspiration to all of us that no matter what obstacles we face, dedication and practice can help us reach our goals. "

Task: Investigate how a program for older and younger students in the same school can help each other and the importance of such a program. Consider how the different levels of responsibility between young and older students can affect the program, scenarios where the program could be beneficial, and any existing drawbacks.","
Programs that bring older and younger students together in the same school can be a powerful tool for education and collaboration. Older students provide insight into more advanced topics and can serve as mentors for younger students as they learn new skills. Younger students, meanwhile, can provide enthusiasm and energy as well as fresh perspectives for the older students. This exchange of ideas and expertise can be very beneficial.

When planning and implementing a program between students of different ages, it is important to consider the different levels of responsibility between the two groups. For example, older students may need to assume additional leadership roles, while younger students may need additional guidance and direction. This can be beneficial in fostering mutual respect and building skills, such as problem solving and communication.

In scenarios where individuals from both groups are actively participating and engaging, it can be especially beneficial. This can include activities such as science fairs, competitions, projects, and more. The opportunity for meaningful interaction can open many doors for both the older and younger students in the program.

Of course, there may be some drawbacks to consider as well. For example, the different levels of maturity and experience between the two groups can sometimes lead to frustrations. To ensure the success of the program, clear communication and mutual understanding between the groups is key. With effective planning and implementation, these programs can contribute to a stimulating and collaborative experience for everyone involved."
