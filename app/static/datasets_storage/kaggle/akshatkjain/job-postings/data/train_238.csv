About us
Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

About us
Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
Life at Builder
It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted.

We believe that data is a means to an end and not an end in itself. We don’t use cutting-edge techniques when not suited to the problem we need to solve. We adapt to what the client truly needs, even if it might look less appealing from a technical perspective. For instance, we won't train a neural network predicting marketing performance based on 1000 variables if a simple dashboard showing marketing efficiency across a few dimensions answers the customer’s question. All our missions are about data, and so far, approximately 50% of them haven’t required any machine learning.

95,Data Scientist,,"Benefits
💜 Working at Agilytic
We aim at creating a work environment that allows you to do exceptional work, grow your skillset and, most importantly, be happy while doing it.
You may work on assignments anywhere in Belgium and neighboring countries like Luxembourg, France, the Netherlands, and the UK. You can expect to interact with IT/data specialists and business executives (marketing, process, customer care).
We believe that data is a means to an end and not an end in itself. We don’t use cutting-edge techniques when not suited to the problem we need to solve. We adapt to what the client truly needs, even if it might look less appealing from a technical perspective. For instance, we won't train a neural network predicting marketing performance based on 1000 variables if a simple dashboard showing marketing efficiency across a few dimensions answers the customer’s question. All our missions are about data, and so far, approximately 50% of them haven’t required any machine learning.
Salary and benefits
💰 Competitive remuneration package: We offer a competitive remuneration package,
Complete with a mobility budget, phone subscription, laptop, meal vouchers, etc.
There is also a variable remuneration component based on client satisfaction/ longevity and your contribution to our business development efforts.
A cafeteria plan in which you can allocate your variable remuneration to your preferred advantages (extra days off, electronics... and cash of course)
🏋️ Training roadmap: We will draft together a training roadmap, taking into consideration our internal competencies as well as your interests.
🤝 Supportive structure and transparency: What we don’t have in scale (yet), we’ll make it up with flexibility, support, and transparency. We will be there for you every step of the way, with individual coaching and career roadmapping.
🧰 Modern tools: Tools are a means to an end. We want them to help you do your best work, not become a bottleneck. That’s why you can expect up-to-date hardware and software tools so that you (hopefully) never have to swear at your computer.
🥂 Oh, and a little bit of fun too: We take our work very seriously, but we’re not afraid to laugh at ourselves. Life is too short.",,"Requirements
