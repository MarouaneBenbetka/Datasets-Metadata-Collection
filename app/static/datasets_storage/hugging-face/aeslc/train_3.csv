"To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:  We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to your questions.
The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.""
This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone).
Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182.
If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.
2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).
Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder.
3)  If you see this error message ""Invalid login; please try again"" (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category.
Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate).
We are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening.
Once we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).

"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails).
We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP.
We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.
We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #).
This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected.
After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track.
Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen.
Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away.
To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days).
This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information.
We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support).
Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again.
Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:

"Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.
A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.
At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation.
Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.
We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.
These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).
Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.
We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.
The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.
The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.
2.
The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.
It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different.
I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.
Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.
I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.
It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.
It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.
Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.
Sincerely,

"Gentlemen  I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.
We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.
Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.
They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.
They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.
To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.
Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.
Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.
The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.
Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.
Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.
Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.
All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.
Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.
The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.
The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.
I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.
I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.
Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.
We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.
Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.
If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.
The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.
Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.
Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.
So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.
Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.
Regards

"The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.
This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).
I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.
For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).
A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).
Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""
She replies:	""No.""
As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.
So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.
The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.
The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.
There are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""  Date & Time Saturday November 3rd.
We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
Where 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire  Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s.
The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit.
Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April.
Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building.
Right before that building is Elm Street.
Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street.

"Hey John!
How are you??
I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've thought of you a lot recently.
I hope things are going well, despite the uncertainty.
I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny story.
Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled instead?
John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known since childhood and is a mentor of sorts.
When he got off the phone, Chuck told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar.
I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.
So I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.
Poor thing says ""yeah, that was me, but not one of my finer moments...""  I could tell he was embarrassed.
I guess there are some things in life you just never live down.
I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.
We shared a cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the same time.
I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and is now doing really well.
They immediately said ""John Arnold!""
Shocked the hell out of me, honestly.
They were very funny in saying that I had made a ""bad trade"" by marrying my husband instead of you.
I told them I would keep that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember off the top of my head.
They both work for a weather trading firm in the Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons.
Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today.
I really do hope you're doing well.

"John and Dutch -  This email is sent to discuss what is needed with respect to NYMEX quotes from the broker market.
Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.
It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:  1.
Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)
2.
Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)
In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.
I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.
We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.
We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.
Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.
However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.
Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.
Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.
Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.
If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the ""war room"" next to Louise's office.

"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better  replicate seasonal fundamentals.
There are convincing arguments as to why  the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.
However, in the previous  methodology they blew out.
For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232  while Cal 10 was .256.
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the  summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months  of July and August over time.
The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for  the month as well as for the year.
These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the  4/5 spread was marked at .0475.
In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month  premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I  change them

"Hi All:  Just got off the phone with the folks @ Dominion regarding some indicative pricing I gave them last week for (i) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in TVA; and, (ii) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in SERC.
FYI, I had quoted the TVA Call  @ $3.97/KW-mo ($1 over our mid) for a 4yr call beginning 1/1/03 with $2 VOM and 5x16 avail with 16hr mins.
I also quoted the SERC 7000 call at $1 over our mid, at $3.98/KW-mo for 1 yr and $4.12/KW-mo for 4 yrs, again with 5x16 and 16 hour mins.

If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.

"Harry, Iris and Brandon:  I asked ConEd if they were prepared to hear our OFFER to buy peaking capacity from the Lakewood expansion.
They are ""in the midst of preparing a draft term sheet for purchasing the output/tolling"" so we'll have to wait to see the parameters of sale.
I also asked if they would like to see PJM WEST synthetic toll offer from us.
Unfortunately, NO.
To the extent it matters, the on-line date is now set for late 2002, so they would like to see our offer for a Jan '03 start date.
Given that these guys are doing a real comparison against bricks and mortar, we would be looking at a $63 million option premium for 500MW @ 3.50/KW-mo over a three-year term; $84 million for a four-year term, I would hope we could be able to find a way to hedge the risk of too many $500 hours killing us.
Is there any cap we could buy to protect our downside risk here and still make this deal attractive?

"Harry and Brandon:   Just to memorialize what I just communicated to Harry over the phone.

Rationale: The TYZ/TYH roll will be impacted by a number of factors.
Most important, we believe, will be changes in the contract's cheapest-to-deliver caused by market movements.
Changes in CTD will change the amount of net positive carry that is the primary determinant of the TYZ/TYH roll's value.
For example, The TYZ/TYH roll priced using the 6.5% 2/10 has 35.75/32 of net carry, while the roll priced with the 4.7% 11/08 has only 28.5/32 of net carry.

"See dear, sometimes you get what you ask for.
Love you-L            A bum, who obviously has seen more than his share of hard times, approaches a well dressed gentleman on the street.
""Hey, Buddy, can you spare two dollars?""
The well-dressed gentleman responds, ""You are not going to spend in on liquor are you?""
""No, sir, I don't drink,"" retorts the bum.
""You are not going to throw it away in some crap game, are  you?""
asks the gentleman.
""No way, I don't gamble,"" answers the bum.
""You wouldn't waste the money at a golf course for greens fees, would you?""
asks the man.
""Never,"" says the bum, ""I don't play golf.""
The man asks the bum if he would like to come home with him for a home cooked meal.
The bum accepts eagerly.
While they are heading for the man's house, the bum's curiosity gets the better of him.
""Isn't your wife going to be angry when she sees a guy like me at your table?""
""Probably,"" says the man, ""but it will be worth it.
I want  her to see what happens to a guy who doesn't drink, gamble  or play golf.""
