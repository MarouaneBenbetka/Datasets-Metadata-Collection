One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.\n\nPredicted attribute: class of iris plant.\n\nThis is an exceedingly simple domain.\n\nThis data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net ).  The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,\"Iris-setosa\" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,\"Iris-setosa\" where the errors are in the second and third features.   \n\n doi code : 10.24432/C56C76", "totalBytes": 0, "creation_date": "1936-01-01T00:00:00.000X", "source": {"name": "UCI-ML-Repo", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/", "description": "The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators widely used by the machine learning community, providing a diverse range of datasets for research and experimentation in various fields of artificial intelligence and data science."}, "stats": null, "owners": [{"name": "R.

It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family. The model was developed within expert system shell for decision making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).\r\n\r\nThe hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure:\r\n\r\n NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools\r\n . EMPLOY           Employment of parents and child's nursery\r\n . . parents        Parents' occupation\r\n . . has_nurs       Child's nursery\r\n .

"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasetshttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/81/data.csv", "description": "Digit database of 250 samples from 44 writers \n\n We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.\r\n\r\nWe use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. \r\n\r\nThese writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this. \r\n\r\nIn our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.  \r\n\r\nIn order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.\r\n\r\nSo, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity. \n\n doi code : 10.24432/C5MG6K", "totalBytes": 0, "creation_date": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.000X", "source": {"name": "UCI-ML-Repo", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/", "description": "The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators widely used by the machine learning community, providing a diverse range of datasets for research and experimentation in various fields of artificial intelligence and data science."}, "stats": null, "owners": [{"name": "E.

generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope \n\n The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\r\n\r\nTypically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\r\n\r\nThe data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in:\r\n    D.

From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Sorting Smoothing Method to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one.

The proposed database can be used to solve two practically important problems: predicting complications of Myocardial Infarction (MI) based on information about the patient (i) at the time of admission and (ii) on the third day of the hospital period. Another important group of tasks is phenotyping of disease (cluster analysis), dynamic phenotyping (filament extraction and identification of disease trajectories) and visualisation (disease mapping). \r\nMI is one of the most challenging problems of modern medicine. Acute myocardial infarction is associated with high mortality in the first year after it. The incidence of MI remains high in all countries. This is especially true for the urban population of highly developed countries, which is exposed to chronic stress factors, irregular and not always balanced nutrition. In the United States, for example, more than a million people suffer from MI every year, and 200-300 thousand of them die from acute MI before arriving at the hospital. \r\nThe course of the disease in patients with MI is different. MI can occur without complications or with complications that do not worsen the long-term prognosis. At the same time, about half of patients in the acute and subacute periods have complications that lead to worsening of the disease and even death. Even an experienced specialist can not always foresee the development of these complications. In this regard, predicting complications of myocardial infarction in order to timely carry out the necessary preventive measures is an important task. \r\n\r\nProblems to solve\r\nIn general columns 2-112 can be used as input data for prediction. Possible complications (outputs) are listed in columns 113-124.\r\nThere are four possible time moments for complication prediction: on base of the information known at\r\n1.\tthe time of admission to hospital: all input columns (2-112) except 93, 94, 95, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n2.\tthe end of the first day (24 hours after admission to the hospital): all input columns (2-112) except 94, 95, 101, 102, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n3.\tthe end of the second day (48 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) except 95, 102, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n4.\tthe end of the third day (72 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) can be used for prediction.\r\n\r\nYou can find detailed description of database, descriptive statistics and csv version of database in DOI: 10.25392/leicester.data.12045261.v3\r\n \n\n doi code : 10.24432/C53P5M", "totalBytes": 0, "creation_date": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000X", "source": {"name": "UCI-ML-Repo", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/", "description": "The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators widely used by the machine learning community, providing a diverse range of datasets for research and experimentation in various fields of artificial intelligence and data science."}, "stats": null, "owners": [{"name": "S.E.

Being able to predict the survival of patients within minutes with as few and easy-to-retrieve medical features as possible is very important. \n\n Primary cohort from Norway:\n- 4 features for 110,204 patient admissions\n- file: 's41598-020-73558-3_sepsis_survival_primary_cohort.csv'\n\nStudy cohort (a subset of the primary cohort) from Norway:\n- 4 features for 19,051 patient admissions\n- file: 's41598-020-73558-3_sepsis_survival_study_cohort.csv'\n\nValidation cohort from South Korea:\n- 4 features for 137 patients\n- file: 's41598-020-73558-3_sepsis_survival_validation_cohort.csv'\n\nThe validation cohort from South Korea was used by Chicco and Jurman (2020) as an external validation cohort to confirm the generalizability of their proposed approach.  \n\n doi code : 10.24432/C53C8N", "totalBytes": 0, "creation_date": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000X", "source": {"name": "UCI-ML-Repo", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/", "description": "The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators widely used by the machine learning community, providing a diverse range of datasets for research and experimentation in various fields of artificial intelligence and data science."}, "stats": null, "owners": [{"name": "Davide Chicco", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Davide+Chicco"}, {"name": "Giuseppe Jurman", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Giuseppe+Jurman"}], "license": {"name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0)", "url": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "description": "This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation.

The goal is to determine these patients' 2- and 6-month survival rates based on several physiologic, demographics, and disease severity information. \nIt is an important problem because it addresses the growing national concern over patients' loss of control near the end of life. It enables earlier decisions and planning to reduce the frequency of a mechanical, painful, and prolonged dying process. \n\n Data sources are medical records, personal interviews, and the National Death Index (NDI). For each patient administrative records data, clinical data and survey data were collected.\nThe objective of the SUPPORT project was to improve decision-making in order to address the growing national concern over the loss of control that patients have near the end of life and to reduce the frequency of a mechanical, painful, and prolonged process of dying. SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospective observational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlled clinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data from patients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care, treatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making among critically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step for devising an intervention strategy for improving critically-ill patients' care and for the construction of statistical models for predicting patient prognosis and functional status. An intervention was implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patients during 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians with accurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival probability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-life care. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of the intervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhance understanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advance planning. The intervention was expected to increase communication, resulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation, decrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in the Intensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increase physician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decrease patient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection in both phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered to patients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews for abstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase II also collected information regarding the implementation of the intervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nurses assigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patients were followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those who did not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matched against the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. Patients who did not die within one year or were lost to follow-up were matched against the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997.\nAll patients in five United States medical centers who met inclusion and exclusion criteria for nine disease categories: acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, liver disease, coma, colon cancer, lung cancer, multiple organ system failure with malignancy, and multiple organ system failure with sepsis. SUPPORT is a combination of patients from 2 studies, each of which lasted 2 years. The first phase concerns 4,301 patients, whereas the second phase concerns 4,804 patients. Time wise, these studies were accessioned in 1989 (June 12) through 1991 (June 11) for phase I and in 1992 (January 7) through 1994 (January 24). \n\n doi code : 10.3886/ICPSR02957.v2", "totalBytes": 0, "creation_date": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.000X", "source": {"name": "UCI-ML-Repo", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/", "description": "The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators widely used by the machine learning community, providing a diverse range of datasets for research and experimentation in various fields of artificial intelligence and data science."}, "stats": null, "owners": [{"name": "Frank Harrel", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Frank+Harrel"}], "license": {"name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0)", "url": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "description": "This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation.

Each patient has (potentially multiple) ultrasound (US) images, aka views, tabular data comprising laboratory, physical examination, scoring results and ultrasonographic findings extracted manually by the experts, and three target variables, namely, diagnosis, management and severity. \n\n This dataset was acquired in a retrospective study from a cohort of pediatric patients admitted with abdominal pain to Children\u2019s Hospital St. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Multiple abdominal B-mode ultrasound images were acquired for most patients, with the number of views varying from 1 to 15. The images depict various regions of interest, such as the abdomen\u2019s right lower quadrant, appendix, intestines, lymph nodes and reproductive organs. Alongside multiple US images for each subject, the dataset includes information encompassing laboratory tests, physical examination results, clinical scores, such as Alvarado and pediatric appendicitis scores, and expert-produced ultrasonographic findings. Lastly, the subjects were labeled w.r.t. three target variables: diagnosis (appendicitis vs. no appendicitis), management (surgical vs. conservative) and severity (complicated vs. uncomplicated or no appendicitis). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Regensburg (no. 18-1063-101, 18-1063_1-101 and 18-1063_2-101) and was performed following applicable guidelines and regulations. \n\n doi code : 10.5281/zenodo.7669442", "totalBytes": 0, "creation_date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000X", "source": {"name": "UCI-ML-Repo", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/", "description": "The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators widely used by the machine learning community, providing a diverse range of datasets for research and experimentation in various fields of artificial intelligence and data science."}, "stats": null, "owners": [{"name": "Ricards Marcinkevics", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Ricards+Marcinkevics"}, {"name": "Patricia Reis", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Patricia+Reis"}, {"name": "Ugne Klimiene", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Ugne+Klimiene"}, {"name": "Ece Ozkan", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Ece+Ozkan"}, {"name": "Kieran Chin-Cheong", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Kieran+Chin-Cheong"}, {"name": "Alyssia Paschke", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Alyssia+Paschke"}, {"name": "Julia Zerres", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Julia+Zerres"}, {"name": "Markus Denzinger", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Markus+Denzinger"}, {"name": "David Niederberger", "ref": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=David+Niederberger"}, {"name": "S.
