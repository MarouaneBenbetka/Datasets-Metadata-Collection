		"description": "# About the Dataset\n## Context\nThis dataset, compiled in 1988, encompasses information from four distinct databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. Comprising 76 attributes, inclusive of the predicted attribute, the dataset has been predominantly utilized in published experiments focusing on a subset of 14 key features. The critical \"target\" field denotes the percentage of heart attack risk in patients.\n\nHeart disease, a collective term for ailments impacting the heart and circulatory system, is a global health concern and a leading cause of disability. Given the heart's pivotal role in bodily functions, diseases affecting it can have far-reaching consequences on other organs and physiological processes. Various forms of heart disease exist, including those causing coronary artery narrowing, valve malfunctions, heart enlargement, and more, often leading to heart failure and heart attacks.\n\nThis dataset, specifically tailored to heart disease, provides a valuable resource for extracting insights that illuminate the significance of each feature and their interrelationships. In this analysis, our primary objective is to ascertain the probability of an individual being susceptible to a severe heart problem.\n\n## Content\n### Attribute Information:\n\n```python\nAge: Numeric (e.g., 52) \nSex: Categorical (0: Female, 1: Male) \nChest Pain Type: Categorical (0: Typical Angina, 1: Atypical Angina, 2: Non-anginal Pain, 3: Asymptomatic) \nResting Blood Pressure: Numeric (e.g., 125) \nSerum Cholesterol: Numeric in mg/dL (e.g., 212) \nFasting Blood Sugar: Categorical (0: &lt;= 120 mg/dL, 1: &gt; 120 mg/dL) \nResting Electrocardiographic Results: Categorical (0: Normal, 1: Abnormality, 2: Hypertrophy) \nMaximum Heart Rate Achieved: Numeric (e.g., 168) \nExercise-Induced Angina: Categorical (0: No, 1: Yes) \nOldpeak (ST Depression): Numeric (e.g., 1.0) \nSlope of Peak Exercise ST Segment: Categorical (0: Upsloping, 1: Flat, 2: Downsloping) \nNumber of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy: Numeric (0 to 3) \nThalassemia: Categorical (0: Normal, 1: Fixed Defect, 2: Reversible Defect)\n```\n\nTo uphold privacy, the dataset has undergone recent modifications, with the removal of patients' names and social security numbers, replaced with anonymized dummy values.",

Your feedback is greatly appreciated and encouraged. We are still learning about what makes a good dataset, so please do share what you find -- both good and bad!\n\nEach essay is a response to the prompt: \"Write an essay that details your experience of applying a specific tool or approach to address a complex challenge. This essay should not only narrate the process but also critically analyze the effectiveness of the chosen tool or approach, reflecting on its strengths and potential limitations.\"\n\nEach essay is also written with a persona. For example:\n&gt; **Name:** Jennifer Hayes  \n**Age:** 35  \n**Occupation:** Social Worker at a Non-Profit Organization  \n**Industry:** Non-Profit  \n**Personality:** Jennifer is a compassionate and empathetic individual who is deeply committed to making a positive impact in her community. She is highly organized and an excellent communicator, with strong problem-solving skills and a talent for building meaningful relationships. Jennifer is also a dedicated and hardworking professional, known for her ability to balance competing priorities and stay focused on her goals.\n\n\nPII is added after the essays are generated using [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) and rules I created based on inspecting the provided dataset. For the entire dataset, here are the token counts for each label:\n\n```\n'O': 2011212\n'I-STREET_ADDRESS': 19422\n'I-PHONE_NUM': 7974\n'I-NAME_STUDENT': 7459\n'B-NAME_STUDENT': 5937\n'B-URL_PERSONAL': 3297\n'B-EMAIL': 2448\n'B-PHONE_NUM': 2388\n'B-ID_NUM': 2376\n'B-USERNAME': 2374\n'B-STREET_ADDRESS': 2294\n'I-ID_NUM': 1059\n```\n\nThe data is in the exact same format as the data provided by the hosts.",

		"description": "UPDATE: Source code used for collecting this data [released here](https://github.com/DataSnaek/Trending-YouTube-Scraper)\n\n### Context\n\nYouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the [top trending videos](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending) on the platform. [According to Variety magazine](http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/youtube-2017-top-trending-videos-music-videos-1202631416/), \u201cTo determine the year\u2019s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they\u2019re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year\u201d. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile \u201cGangam Style\u201d), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.\n\nThis dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.\n\nNote that this dataset is a structurally improved version of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube).\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the US, GB, DE, CA, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and France, respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.\n\nEDIT: Now includes data from RU, MX, KR, JP and IN regions (Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and India respectively) over the same time period.  \n\nEach region\u2019s data is in a separate file. Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.\n\nThe data also includes a `category_id` field, which varies between regions. To retrieve the categories for a specific video, find it in the associated `JSON`. One such file is included for each of the five regions in the dataset.\n\nFor more information on specific columns in the dataset refer to the [column metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new/data).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset was collected using the YouTube API.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nPossible uses for this dataset could include:\n\n* Sentiment analysis in a variety of forms\n* Categorising YouTube videos based on their comments and statistics.\n* Training ML algorithms like RNNs to generate their own YouTube comments.\n* Analysing what factors affect how popular a YouTube video will be.\n* Statistical analysis over time\f.\n\nFor further inspiration, see the kernels on this dataset!",

		"url": "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/",
		"description": "### Context\n\nAfter watching [Somm](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204371/) (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!\n\n### Content\n\n\nThis dataset contains three files:\n\n- **winemag-data-130k-v2.csv** contains 10 columns and 130k rows of wine reviews. \n\n- **winemag-data_first150k.csv** contains 10 columns and 150k rows of wine reviews.  \n\n- **winemag-data-130k-v2.json** contains 6919 nodes of wine reviews. \n\nClick on the data tab to see individual file descriptions, column-level metadata and summary statistics.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data was scraped from [WineEnthusiast](http://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) during the week of June 15th, 2017. The code for the scraper can be found [here](https://github.com/zackthoutt/wine-deep-learning) if you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address.\n\n**UPDATE 11/24/2017**\nAfter feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd, 2017. This time around I collected the title of each review, which you can parse the year out of, the tasters name, and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them.",
