        "description": "2011 to present. BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This dataset is one of the datasets provided by National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by location (national, state, county, and selected sites) and indicator, and they include CVDs (e.g., heart failure) and risk factors (e.g., hypertension). The data can be plotted as trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.\n\nSource: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/behavioral-risk-factor-data-heart-disease-amp-stroke-prevention\n\nWhat is the difference between stroke and heart in symptoms?\nThe most common difference between stroke and heart attack is in its symptoms. A stroke occurs with symptoms such as cold sweat, shortness of breath, and nausea. Also, a person who is facing a heart attack feels pain and discomfort in the chest and the pain extends to his left arm.\n\nOf course, those who have a silent heart attack have no symptoms or mild symptoms. The symptoms of a stroke are quite different and depend on the part of the brain that is damaged.\n\nTo prevent a heart attack, it is better to pay attention to the symptoms of chest pain and maintain your health by visiting a heart attack doctor on time.\n\nSymptoms of a stroke include severe headache, slurred speech, and vision in one or both eyes. Also, the difference between a stroke and a heart attack is that a person who suffers a stroke suddenly cannot walk and loses his balance and may even experience dizziness and vomiting.\n\nOne of the actions of the stroke doctor is to prescribe drugs that destroy the blood clot and remove the blockage of the vessels in order to reduce the brain damage of the patients.\n",

Fisher's classic 1936 paper, [The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems](http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf), and can also be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository][1].\n\nIt includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.\n\nThe columns in this dataset are:\n\n - Id\n - SepalLengthCm\n - SepalWidthCm\n - PetalLengthCm\n - PetalWidthCm\n - Species\n\n[![Sepal Width vs. Sepal Length](https://www.kaggle.io/svf/138327/e401fb2cc596451b1e4d025aaacda95f/sepalWidthvsLength.png)](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/d/uciml/iris/sepal-width-vs-length)\n\n\n  [1]: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/",

        "description": "Context\n---------\n\nIt is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.\n\nContent\n---------\n\nThe dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. \nThis dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.\n\nIt contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. \n\nGiven the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.\n\nUpdate (03/05/2021)\n---------\n\nA simulator for transaction data has been released as part of the practical handbook on Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection - https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Chapter_3_GettingStarted/SimulatedDataset.html. We invite all practitioners interested in fraud detection datasets to also check out this data simulator, and the methodologies for credit card fraud detection presented in the book.\n\nAcknowledgements\n---------\n\nThe dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.\nMore details on current and past projects on related topics are available on [https://www.researchgate.net/project/Fraud-detection-5][1] and the page of the [DefeatFraud][2] project\n\nPlease cite the following works: \n\nAndrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, Reid A.

The primary goal of this dataset is to aid in developing and evaluating algorithms for **automated bone fracture detection**. \n\nThe dataset contains images categorized into different classes, each representing a specific type of bone fracture. These classes include **Elbow Positive**, **Fingers Positive**, **Forearm Fracture**, **Humerus Fracture**, **Shoulder Fracture**, and **Wrist Positive**. \n\nEach image in the dataset is annotated with either bounding boxes or pixel-level segmentation masks to indicate the location and extent of the detected fracture. This facilitates the training and evaluation of bone fracture detection algorithms.\n\nThe bone fracture detection dataset is a useful resource for researchers and developers who want to train machine learning models, specifically focusing on object detection algorithms, to automatically detect and classify bone fractures in X-ray images. The dataset's diversity of fracture classes enables the development of robust models capable of accurately identifying fractures in different regions of the upper extremities.\n\nThe aim of creating this dataset is to accelerate the development of computer vision solutions for **automated fracture detection**, supporting advancements in medical diagnostics and improving patient care.",

While doing so, over the past few months I've generated a large amount of text using various LLMs. This is a dataset/corpus containing all of the data I generated/gathered as well as the text that was generated by various other users.\n\nIf you have any questions please post them on the Discussion page or contact me through Kaggle. Generating all of this took many hours of work and a few hundred dollars, all I ask in return is that you credit me if you find this dataset useful in your research. Also, an upvote would mean the world.\n\nPs. The picture is of my dog, Tessa, who passed away recently. I wasn't sure what to put as the picture so I thought that was better than nothing.\n\nHere are the datasets I used in addition to the text I generated **PLEASE UPVOTE THEM!**:\n\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v3-train-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alejopaullier/daigt-external-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nbroad/persaude-corpus-2\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nbroad/daigt-data-llama-70b-and-falcon180b\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radek1/llm-generated-essays\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darraghdog/hello-claude-1000-essays-from-anthropic\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingki19/llm-generated-essay-using-palm-from-google-gen-ai\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-proper-train-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data\n- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning/data\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/japkeeratsingh/ielts-writing\n- https://github.com/yafuly/DeepfakeTextDetect\n- https://huggingface.co/datasets/qwedsacf/ivypanda-essays\n- https://huggingface.co/datasets/nid989/EssayFroum-Dataset\n- https://huggingface.co/datasets/whateverweird17/essay_grade_v1\n- https://huggingface.co/datasets/dim/essayforum_raw_writing_10k\n- https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChristophSchuhmann/essays-with-instructions\n- https://huggingface.co/datasets/whateverweird17/essay_grade_v2",
